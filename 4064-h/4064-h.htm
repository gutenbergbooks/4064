      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The prudent husbandman, after having taken from his field all the straw
      that is there, rakes it over with a wooden rake and gets as much again.
      The wise child, after the lemonade jug is empty, takes the lemons from the
      bottom of it and squeezes them into a still larger brew. So does the
      sagacious author, after having sold his material to the magazines and been
      paid for it, clap it into book-covers and give it another squeeze. But in
      the present case the author is of a nice conscience and anxious to place
      responsibility where it is due. He therefore wishes to make all proper
      acknowledgments to the editors of Vanity Fair, The American Magazine, The
      Popular Magazine, Life, Puck, The Century, Methuen&rsquo;s Annual, and all
      others who are in any way implicated in the making of this book.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Readers are requested to note that this novel has taken our special prize
      of a cheque for a thousand guineas. This alone guarantees for all
      intelligent readers a palpitating interest in every line of it. Among the
      thousands of MSS. which reached us&mdash;many of them coming in carts
      early in the morning, and moving in a dense phalanx, indistinguishable
      from the Covent Garden Market waggons; others pouring down our coal-chute
      during the working hours of the day; and others again being slipped
      surreptitiously into our letter-box by pale, timid girls, scarcely more
      than children, after nightfall (in fact many of them came in their
      night-gowns),&mdash;this manuscript alone was the sole one&mdash;in fact
      the only one&mdash;to receive the prize of a cheque of a thousand guineas.
      To other competitors we may have given, inadvertently perhaps, a bag of
      sovereigns or a string of pearls, but to this story alone is awarded the
      first prize by the unanimous decision of our judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say that the latter body included two members of the Cabinet, two
      Lords of the Admiralty, and two bishops, with power in case of dispute to
      send all the MSS. to the Czar of Russia, our readers will breathe a sigh
      of relief to learn that the decision was instant and unanimous. Each one
      of them, in reply to our telegram, answered immediately SPOOF.
    </p>
    <p>
      This novel represents the last word in up-to-date fiction. It is well
      known that the modern novel has got far beyond the point of mere
      story-telling. The childish attempt to INTEREST the reader has long since
      been abandoned by all the best writers. They refuse to do it. The modern
      novel must convey a message, or else it must paint a picture, or remove a
      veil, or open a new chapter in human psychology. Otherwise it is no good.
      SPOOF does all of these things. The reader rises from its perusal
      perplexed, troubled, and yet so filled with information that rising itself
      is a difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot, for obvious reasons, insert the whole of the first chapter. But
      the portion here presented was praised by The Saturday Afternoon Review as
      giving one of the most graphic and at the same time realistic pictures of
      America ever written in fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the characters whom our readers are to imagine seated on the deck&mdash;on
      one of the many decks (all connected by elevators)&mdash;of the
      Gloritania, one word may be said. Vere de Lancy is (as the reviewers have
      under oath declared) a typical young Englishman of the upper class. He is
      nephew to the Duke of&mdash;, but of this fact no one on the ship, except
      the captain, the purser, the steward, and the passengers are, or is,
      aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order entirely to conceal his identity, Vere de Lancy is travelling
      under the assumed name of Lancy de Vere. In order the better to hide the
      object of his journey, Lancy de Vere (as we shall now call him, though our
      readers will be able at any moment to turn his name backwards) has given
      it to be understood that he is travelling merely as a gentleman anxious to
      see America. This naturally baffles all those in contact with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl at his side&mdash;but perhaps we may best let her speak for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow as they sat together on the deck of the great steamer in the
      afterglow of the sunken sun, listening to the throbbing of the propeller
      (a rare sound which neither of them of course had ever heard before), de
      Vere felt that he must speak to her. Something of the mystery of the girl
      fascinated him. What was she doing here alone with no one but her mother
      and her maid, on the bosom of the Atlantic? Why was she here? Why was she
      not somewhere else? The thing puzzled, perplexed him. It would not let him
      alone. It fastened upon his brain. Somehow he felt that if he tried to
      drive it away, it might nip him in the ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too,&rdquo; he said, leaning over her deck-chair, &ldquo;are
      going to America?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had suspected this ever since the boat left Liverpool. Now at length he
      framed his growing conviction into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented, and then timidly, &ldquo;it is 3,213
      miles wide, is it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and 1,781 miles deep! It reaches from
      the forty-ninth parallel to the Gulf of Mexico.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;what a vivid picture! I seem to
      see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its major axis,&rdquo; he went on, his voice sinking almost to a
      caress, &ldquo;is formed by the Rocky Mountains, which are practically a
      prolongation of the Cordilleran Range. It is drained,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, is it not? It is drained by the Mississippi, by the St.
      Lawrence, and&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;by the Upper Colorado.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow his hand had found hers in the half gloaming, but she did not
      check him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said very simply; &ldquo;I think I ought to hear
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great central plain of the interior,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;is formed by a vast alluvial deposit carried down as silt by the
      Mississippi. East of this the range of the Alleghanies, nowhere more than
      eight thousand feet in height, forms a secondary or subordinate axis from
      which the watershed falls to the Atlantic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking very quietly but earnestly. No man had ever spoken to her
      like this before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful picture!&rdquo; she murmured half to herself, half
      aloud, and half not aloud and half not to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the whole of it,&rdquo; de Vere went on, &ldquo;there run
      railways, most of them from east to west, though a few run from west to
      east. The Pennsylvania system alone has twenty-one thousand miles of
      track.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-one thousand miles,&rdquo; she repeated; already she felt
      her will strangely subordinate to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was holding her hand firmly clasped in his and looking into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare I tell you,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;how many employees it
      has?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she gasped, unable to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and fourteen thousand,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. They were both thinking. Presently she spoke, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any cities there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cities!&rdquo; he said enthusiastically, &ldquo;ah, yes! let me try
      to give you a word-picture of them. Vast cities&mdash;with tall buildings,
      reaching to the very sky. Why, for instance, the new Woolworth Building in
      New York&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she broke in quickly, &ldquo;how high is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven hundred and fifty feet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it. Some
      other time, perhaps, but not now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen and was gathering up her wraps. &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;why are you going to America?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Because I want to see, to know, to
      learn. And when I have learned and seen and known, I want other people to
      see and to learn and to know. I want to write it all down, all the vast
      palpitating picture of it. Ah! if I only could&mdash;I want to see&rdquo;
      (and here he passed his hand through his hair as if trying to remember)
      &ldquo;something of the relations of labour and capital, of the
      extraordinary development of industrial machinery, of the new and
      intricate organisation of corporation finance, and in particular I want to
      try to analyse&mdash;no one has ever done it yet&mdash;the men who guide
      and drive it all. I want to set down the psychology of the
      multimillionaire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. The girl stood irresolute. She was thinking (apparently, for if
      not, why stand there?).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;I could help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I might.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;come
      from America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said de Vere in astonishment. &ldquo;With a face and
      voice like yours! It is impossible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldness of the compliment held her speechless for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my people lived just outside of
      Cohoes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; he said passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t speak to you like this,&rdquo; the girl went on,
      &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s because I feel from what you have said that you know
      and love America. And I think I can help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said, divining her idea, &ldquo;that you can
      help me to meet a multimillionaire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, still hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; still hesitating, &ldquo;I know ONE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed about to say more, her lips had already opened, when suddenly
      the dull raucous blast of the foghorn (they used a raucous one on this
      ship on purpose) cut the night air. Wet fog rolled in about them, wetting
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;good night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment de Vere was about to detain her. The wild thought leaped to
      his mind to ask her her name or at least her mother&rsquo;s. With a
      powerful effort he checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Limits of space forbid the insertion of the whole of this chapter. Its
      opening contains one of the most vivid word-pictures of the inside of an
      American customs house ever pictured in words. From the customs wharf de
      Vere is driven in a taxi to the Belmont. Here he engages a room; here,
      too, he sleeps; here also, though cautiously at first, he eats. All this
      is so admirably described that only those who have driven in a taxi to an
      hotel and slept there can hope to appreciate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limits of space also forbid our describing in full de Vere&rsquo;s vain
      quest in New York of the beautiful creature whom he had met on the steamer
      and whom he had lost from sight in the aigrette department of the customs
      house. A thousand times he cursed his folly in not having asked her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile no word comes from her, till suddenly, mysteriously,
      unexpectedly, on the fourth day a note is handed to de Vere by the Third
      Assistant Head Waiter of the Belmont. It is addressed in a lady&rsquo;s
      hand. He tears it open. It contains only the written words, &ldquo;Call on
      Mr. J. Superman Overgold. He is a multimillionaire. He expects you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To leap into a taxi (from the third story of the Belmont) was the work of
      a moment. To drive to the office of Mr. Overgold was less. The portion of
      the novel which follows is perhaps the most notable part of it. It is this
      part of the chapter which the Hibbert Journal declares to be the best
      piece of psychological analysis that appears in any novel of the season.
      We reproduce it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, exactly,&rdquo; said de Vere, writing rapidly in his
      note-book as he sat in one of the deep leather armchairs of the luxurious
      office of Mr. Overgold. &ldquo;So you sometimes feel as if the whole thing
      were not worth while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Overgold. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help asking
      myself what it all means. Is life, after all, merely a series of
      immaterial phenomena, self-developing and based solely on sensation and
      reaction, or is it something else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment to sign a cheque for $10,000 and throw it out of
      the window, and then went on, speaking still with the terse brevity of a
      man of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is sensation everywhere or is there perception too? On what
      grounds, if any, may the hypothesis of a self-explanatory consciousness be
      rejected? In how far are we warranted in supposing that innate ideas are
      inconsistent with pure materialism?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere listened, fascinated. Fortunately for himself, he was a University
      man, fresh from the examination halls of his Alma Mater. He was able to
      respond at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said modestly, &ldquo;I grasp your thought. You
      mean&mdash;to what extent are we prepared to endorse Hegel&rsquo;s dictum
      of immaterial evolution?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Mr. Overgold. &ldquo;How far, if at all, do we
      substantiate the Kantian hypothesis of the transcendental?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said de Vere eagerly. &ldquo;And for what reasons
      [naming them] must we reject Spencer&rsquo;s theory of the unknowable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely so,&rdquo; continued Mr. Overgold. &ldquo;And why, if at
      all, does Bergsonian illusionism differ from pure nothingness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They both paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Overgold had risen. There was great weariness in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It saddens one, does it not?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had picked up a bundle of Panama two per cent. gold bonds and was
      looking at them in contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The emptiness of it all!&rdquo; he muttered. He extended the bonds
      to de Vere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or shall I throw them
      away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them to me,&rdquo; said de Vere quietly; &ldquo;they are not
      worth the throwing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Overgold, speaking half to himself, as he
      replaced the bonds in his desk. &ldquo;It is a burden that I must carry
      alone. I have no right to ask any one to share it. But come,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;I fear I am sadly lacking in the duties of international
      hospitality. I am forgetting what I owe to Anglo-American courtesy. I am
      neglecting the new obligations of our common Indo-Chinese policy. My motor
      is at the door. Pray let me take you to my house to lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere assented readily, telephoned to the Belmont not to keep lunch
      waiting for him, and in a moment was speeding up the magnificent Riverside
      Drive towards Mr. Overgold&rsquo;s home. On the way Mr. Overgold pointed
      out various objects of interest,&mdash;Grant&rsquo;s tomb, Lincoln&rsquo;s
      tomb, Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s grave, the ticket office of the New York
      Subway, and various other points of historic importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the house, de Vere was ushered up a flight of broad marble
      steps to a hall fitted on every side with almost priceless objets d&rsquo;art
      and others, ushered to the cloak-room and out of it, butlered into the
      lunch-room and footmanned to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered, a lady already seated at the table turned to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance was enough&mdash;plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she&mdash;the object of de Vere&rsquo;s impassioned quest. A rich
      lunch-gown was girdled about her with a twelve-o&rsquo;clock band of
      pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached out her hand, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothea,&rdquo; said the multimillionaire, &ldquo;this is Mr. de
      Vere. Mr. de Vere&mdash;my wife.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of this next chapter we need only say that the Blue Review (Adults Only)
      declares it to be the most daring and yet conscientious handling of the
      sex-problem ever attempted and done. The fact that the Congregational
      Times declares that this chapter will undermine the whole foundations of
      English Society and let it fall, we pass over: we hold certificates in
      writing from a great number of the Anglican clergy, to the effect that
      they have carefully read the entire novel and see nothing in it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      . . . . . . .
    </h3>
    <p>
      They stood looking at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash de Vere realised that she hadn&rsquo;t known that he didn&rsquo;t
      know and knew now that he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found no words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was a tense one. Nothing but the woman&rsquo;s innate tact
      could save it. Dorothea Overgold rose to it with the dignity of a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your soup over to the window,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and eat
      it there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The millionaire took his soup to the window and sat beneath a little palm
      tree, eating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said de Vere; &ldquo;how could I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you loved me, although you didn&rsquo;t
      know that I was married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered de Vere simply. &ldquo;I loved you, in spite
      of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Mr. Overgold had returned to the
      table, the empty plate in his hand. His wife turned to him again with the
      same unfailing tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your asparagus to the billiard-room,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
      eat it there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know, too?&rdquo; asked de Vere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Overgold?&rdquo; she said carelessly. &ldquo;I suppose he does.
      Eh apres, mon ami?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      French? Another mystery! Where and how had she learned it? de Vere asked
      himself. Not in France, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that you are very young, amico mio,&rdquo; Dorothea went on
      carelessly. &ldquo;After all, what is there wrong in it, piccolo pochito?
      To a man&rsquo;s mind perhaps&mdash;but to a woman, love is love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She beckoned to the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Mr. Overgold a cutlet to the music-room,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and give him his gorgonzola on the inkstand in the library.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she went on, in that caressing way which seemed so
      natural to her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us think about it any more! After
      all, what is is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; said de Vere, half convinced in spite of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at any rate,&rdquo; said Dorothea, &ldquo;nothing can at the
      same time both be and not be. But come,&rdquo; she broke off, gaily
      dipping a macaroon in a glass of creme de menthe and offering it to him
      with a pretty gesture of camaraderie, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be
      gloomy any more. I want to take you with me to the matinee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he coming?&rdquo; asked de Vere, pointing at Mr. Overgold&rsquo;s
      empty chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly boy,&rdquo; laughed Dorothea. &ldquo;Of course John is
      coming. You surely don&rsquo;t want to buy the tickets yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      . . . . . . .
    </h3>
    <p>
      The days that followed brought a strange new life to de Vere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothea was ever at his side. At the theatre, at the polo ground, in the
      park, everywhere they were together. And with them was Mr. Overgold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three were always together. At times at the theatre Dorothea and de
      Vere would sit downstairs and Mr. Overgold in the gallery; at other times,
      de Vere and Mr. Overgold would sit in the gallery and Dorothea downstairs;
      at times one of them would sit in Row A, another in Row B, and a third in
      Row C; at other times two would sit in Row B and one in Row C; at the
      opera, at times, one of the three would sit listening, the others talking,
      at other times two listening and one talking, and at other times three
      talking and none listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the three formed together one of the most perplexing, maddening
      triangles that ever disturbed the society of the metropolis.
    </p>
    <h3>
      . . . . . . .
    </h3>
    <p>
      The denouement was bound to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere was standing beside Dorothea in the brilliantly lighted hall of
      the Grand Palaver Hotel, where they had had supper. Mr. Overgold was busy
      for a moment at the cashier&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothea,&rdquo; de Vere whispered passionately, &ldquo;I want to
      take you away, away from all this. I want you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and looked him full in the face. Then she put her hand in his,
      smiling bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the Gloritania sails for England
      to-morrow at midnight. I have everything ready. Will you come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I will&rdquo;; and then
      passionately, &ldquo;Dearest, I will follow you to England, to Liverpool,
      to the end of the earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused in thought a moment and then added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the house just before midnight. William, the second
      chauffeur (he is devoted to me), shall be at the door with the third car.
      The fourth footman will bring my things&mdash;I can rely on him; the fifth
      housemaid can have them all ready&mdash;she would never betray me. I will
      have the undergardener&mdash;the sixth&mdash;waiting at the iron gate to
      let you in; he would die rather than fail me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused again&mdash;then she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one thing, dearest, that I want to ask. It is not
      much. I hardly think you would refuse it at such an hour. May I bring my
      husband with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere&rsquo;s face blanched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must,&rdquo; said Dorothea. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
      how I&rsquo;ve grown to value, to lean upon, him. At times I have felt as
      if I always wanted him to be near me; I like to feel wherever I am&mdash;at
      the play, at a restaurant, anywhere &mdash;that I can reach out and touch
      him. I know,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s only a wild
      fancy and that others would laugh at it, but you can understand, can you
      not&mdash;carino caruso mio? And think, darling, in our new life, how busy
      he, too, will be&mdash;making money for all of us&mdash;in a new money
      market. It&rsquo;s just wonderful how he does it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A great light of renunciation lit up de Vere&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you would say that,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and
      listen, pochito pocket-edition, may I ask one thing more, one weeny thing?
      William, the second chauffeur&mdash;I think he would fade away if I were
      gone&mdash;may I bring him, too? Yes! O my darling, how can I repay you?
      And the second footman, and the third housemaid&mdash;if I were gone I
      fear that none of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them all,&rdquo; said de Vere half bitterly; &ldquo;we will
      all elope together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke Mr. Overgold sauntered over from the cashier&rsquo;s desk,
      his open purse still in his hand, and joined them. There was a dreamy look
      upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;whether personality survives
      or whether it, too, when up against the irresistible, dissolves and
      resolves itself into a series of negative reactions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere&rsquo;s empty heart echoed the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they passed out and the night swallowed them up.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      At a little before midnight on the next night, two motors filled with
      muffled human beings might have been perceived, or seen, moving
      noiselessly from Riverside Drive to the steamer wharf where lay the
      Gloritania.
    </p>
    <p>
      A night of intense darkness enveloped the Hudson. Outside the inside of
      the dockside a dense fog wrapped the Statue of Liberty. Beside the steamer
      customs officers and deportation officials moved silently to and fro in
      long black cloaks, carrying little deportation lanterns in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these Mr. Overgold presented in silence his deportation certificates,
      granting his party permission to leave the United States under the
      imbecility clause of the Interstate Commerce Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      No objection was raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the huge steamer was slipping away in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On its deck a little group of people, standing beside a pile of
      first-class cabin luggage, directed a last sad look through their heavy
      black disguise at the rapidly vanishing shore which they could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere, who stood in the midst of them, clasping their hands, thus stood
      and gazed his last at America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoof!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      (We admit that this final panorama, weird in its midnight mystery, and
      filling the mind of the reader with a sense of something like awe, is only
      appended to Spoof in order to coax him to read our forthcoming sequel,
      Spiff!)

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;THE READING PUBLIC. A BOOK STORE STUDY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish to look about the store? Oh, oh, by all means, sir,&rdquo; he
      said. Then as he rubbed his hands together in an urbane fashion he
      directed a piercing glance at me through his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find some things that might interest you,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;in the back of the store on the left. We have there a series
      of reprints&mdash;Universal Knowledge from Aristotle to Arthur Balfour&mdash;at
      seventeen cents. Or perhaps you might like to look over the Pantheon of
      Dead Authors at ten cents. Mr. Sparrow,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;just show
      this gentleman our classical reprints&mdash;the ten-cent series.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he waved his hand to an assistant and dismissed me from his
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, he had divined me in a moment. There was no use in my
      having bought a sage-green fedora in Broadway, and a sporting tie done up
      crosswise with spots as big as nickels. These little adornments can never
      hide the soul within. I was a professor, and he knew it, or at least, as
      part of his business, he could divine it on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sales manager of the biggest book store for ten blocks cannot be
      deceived in a customer. And he knew, of course, that, as a professor, I
      was no good. I had come to the store, as all professors go to book stores,
      just as a wasp comes to an open jar of marmalade. He knew that I would
      hang around for two hours, get in everybody&rsquo;s way, and finally buy a
      cheap reprint of the Dialogues of Plato, or the Prose Works of John
      Milton, or Locke on the Human Understanding, or some trash of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for real taste in literature&mdash;the ability to appreciate at its
      worth a dollar-fifty novel of last month, in a spring jacket with a tango
      frontispiece&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t got it and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He despised me, of course. But it is a maxim of the book business that a
      professor standing up in a corner buried in a book looks well in a store.
      The real customers like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that even so up-to-date a manager as Mr. Sellyer tolerated my
      presence in a back corner of his store: and so it was that I had an
      opportunity of noting something of his methods with his real customers&mdash;methods
      so successful, I may say, that he is rightly looked upon by all the
      publishing business as one of the mainstays of literature in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no intention of standing in the place and listening as a spy. In
      fact, to tell the truth, I had become immediately interested in a new
      translation of the Moral Discourses of Epictetus. The book was very neatly
      printed, quite well bound and was offered at eighteen cents; so that for
      the moment I was strongly tempted to buy it, though it seemed best to take
      a dip into it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hardly read more than the first three chapters when my attention was
      diverted by a conversation going on in the front of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure it&rsquo;s his LATEST?&rdquo; a fashionably
      dressed lady was saying to Mr. Sellyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Mrs. Rasselyer,&rdquo; answered the manager. &ldquo;I
      assure you this is his very latest. In fact, they only came in yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he indicated with his hand a huge pile of books, gayly
      jacketed in white and blue. I could make out the title in big gilt
      lettering&mdash;GOLDEN DREAMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Sellyer. &ldquo;This is Mr. Slush&rsquo;s
      latest book. It&rsquo;s having a wonderful sale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;You see,
      one sometimes gets taken in so: I came in here last week and took two that
      seemed very nice, and I never noticed till I got home that they were both
      old books, published, I think, six months ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me, Mrs. Rasselyer,&rdquo; said the manager in an
      apologetic tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely sorry. Pray let us send for
      them and exchange them for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it does not matter,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;of course I
      didn&rsquo;t read them. I gave them to my maid. She probably wouldn&rsquo;t
      know the difference, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Mr. Sellyer, with a condescending smile.
      &ldquo;But of course, madam,&rdquo; he went on, falling into the easy chat
      of the fashionable bookman, &ldquo;such mistakes are bound to happen
      sometimes. We had a very painful case only yesterday. One of our oldest
      customers came in in a great hurry to buy books to take on the steamer,
      and before we realised what he had done&mdash;selecting the books I
      suppose merely by the titles, as some gentlemen are apt to do&mdash;he had
      taken two of last year&rsquo;s books. We wired at once to the steamer, but
      I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now, this book,&rdquo; said the lady, idly turning over the
      leaves, &ldquo;is it good? What is it about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an extremely POWERFUL thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Sellyer,
      &ldquo;in fact, MASTERLY. The critics are saying that it&rsquo;s perhaps
      THE most powerful book of the season. It has a&mdash;&rdquo; and here Mr.
      Sellyer paused, and somehow his manner reminded me of my own when I am
      explaining to a university class something that I don&rsquo;t know myself&mdash;&ldquo;It
      has a&mdash;a&mdash;POWER, so to speak&mdash;a very exceptional power; in
      fact, one may say without exaggeration it is the most POWERFUL book of the
      month. Indeed,&rdquo; he added, getting on to easier ground, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      having a perfectly wonderful sale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have a great many of them,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have to,&rdquo; answered the manager. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      regular rush on the book. Indeed, you know it&rsquo;s a book that is bound
      to make a sensation. In fact, in certain quarters, they are saying that it&rsquo;s
      a book that ought not to&mdash;&rdquo; And here Mr. Sellyer&rsquo;s voice
      became so low and ingratiating that I couldn&rsquo;t hear the rest of the
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really!&rdquo; said Mrs. Rasselyer. &ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;ll
      take it then. One ought to see what these talked-of things are about,
      anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already begun to button her gloves, and to readjust her feather
      boa with which she had been knocking the Easter cards off the counter.
      Then she suddenly remembered something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was forgetting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you send
      something to the house for Mr. Rasselyer at the same time? He&rsquo;s
      going down to Virginia for the vacation. You know the kind of thing he
      likes, do you not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly, madam,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;Mr. Rasselyer
      generally reads works of&mdash;er&mdash;I think he buys mostly books on&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, travel and that sort of thing,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I think we have here,&rdquo; and he pointed to the
      counter on the left, &ldquo;what Mr. Rasselyer wants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He indicated a row of handsome books&mdash;&ldquo;Seven Weeks in the
      Sahara, seven dollars; Six Months in a Waggon, six-fifty net; Afternoons
      in an Oxcart, two volumes, four-thirty, with twenty off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has read those,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rasselyer. &ldquo;At
      least there are a good many at home that seem like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very possibly&mdash;but here, now, Among the Cannibals of Corfu&mdash;yes,
      that I think he has had&mdash;Among the&mdash;that, too, I think&mdash;but
      this I am certain he would like, just in this morning&mdash;Among the
      Monkeys of New Guinea&mdash;ten dollars, net.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this Mr. Sellyer laid his hand on a pile of new books, apparently
      as numerous as the huge pile of Golden Dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the Monkeys,&rdquo; he repeated, almost caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems rather expensive,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very much so&mdash;a most expensive book,&rdquo; the manager
      repeated in a tone of enthusiasm. &ldquo;You see, Mrs. Rasselyer, it&rsquo;s
      the illustrations, actual photographs&rdquo;&mdash;he ran the leaves over
      in his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;of actual monkeys, taken with the camera&mdash;and
      the paper, you notice&mdash;in fact, madam, the book costs, the mere
      manufacture of it, nine dollars and ninety cents&mdash;of course we make
      no profit on it. But it&rsquo;s a book we like to handle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody likes to be taken into the details of technical business; and of
      course everybody likes to know that a bookseller is losing money. These, I
      realised, were two axioms in the methods of Mr. Sellyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So very naturally Mrs. Rasselyer bought Among the Monkeys, and in another
      moment Mr. Sellyer was directing a clerk to write down an address on Fifth
      Avenue, and was bowing deeply as he showed the lady out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned back to his counter his manner seemed much changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Monkey book,&rdquo; I heard him murmur to his assistant,
      &ldquo;is going to be a pretty stiff proposition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no time for further speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another lady entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time even to an eye less trained than Mr. Sellyer&rsquo;s, the deep,
      expensive mourning and the pensive face proclaimed the sentimental widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something new in fiction,&rdquo; repeated the manager, &ldquo;yes,
      madam&mdash;here&rsquo;s a charming thing&mdash;Golden Dreams&rdquo;&mdash;he
      hung lovingly on the words&mdash;&ldquo;a very sweet story, singularly
      sweet; in fact, madam, the critics are saying it is the sweetest thing
      that Mr. Slush has done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it good?&rdquo; said the lady. I began to realise that all
      customers asked this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming book,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a love
      story&mdash;very simple and sweet, yet wonderfully charming. Indeed, the
      reviews say it&rsquo;s the most charming book of the month. My wife was
      reading it aloud only last night. She could hardly read for tears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s quite a safe book, is it?&rdquo; asked the
      widow. &ldquo;I want it for my little daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite safe,&rdquo; said Mr. Sellyer, with an almost parental
      tone, &ldquo;in fact, written quite in the old style, like the dear old
      books of the past&mdash;quite like&rdquo;&mdash;here Mr. Sellyer paused
      with a certain slight haze of doubt visible in his eye&mdash;&ldquo;like
      Dickens and Fielding and Sterne and so on. We sell a great many to the
      clergy, madam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady bought Golden Dreams, received it wrapped up in green enamelled
      paper, and passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any good light reading for vacation time?&rdquo; called
      out the next customer in a loud, breezy voice&mdash;he had the air of a
      stock broker starting on a holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Sellyer, and his face almost broke into a
      laugh as he answered, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s an excellent thing&mdash;Golden
      Dreams&mdash;quite the most humorous book of the season&mdash;simply
      screaming&mdash;my wife was reading it aloud only yesterday. She could
      hardly read for laughing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price, one dollar? One-fifty. All right, wrap it
      up.&rdquo; There was a clink of money on the counter, and the customer was
      gone. I began to see exactly where professors and college people who want
      copies of Epictetus at 18 cents and sections of World Reprints of
      Literature at 12 cents a section come in, in the book trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Judge!&rdquo; said the manager to the next customer, a huge,
      dignified personage in a wide-awake hat, &ldquo;sea stories? Certainly.
      Excellent reading, no doubt, when the brain is overcharged as yours must
      be. Here is the very latest&mdash;Among the Monkeys of New Guinea, ten
      dollars, reduced to four-fifty. The manufacture alone costs six-eighty. We&rsquo;re
      selling it out. Thank you, Judge. Send it? Yes. Good morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the customers came and went in a string. I noticed that though
      the store was filled with books&mdash;ten thousand of them, at a guess&mdash;Mr.
      Sellyer was apparently only selling two. Every woman who entered went away
      with Golden Dreams: every man was given a copy of the Monkeys of New
      Guinea. To one lady Golden Dreams was sold as exactly the reading for a
      holiday, to another as the very book to read AFTER a holiday; another
      bought it as a book for a rainy day, and a fourth as the right sort of
      reading for a fine day. The Monkeys was sold as a sea story, a land story,
      a story of the jungle, and a story of the mountains, and it was put at a
      price corresponding to Mr. Sellyer&rsquo;s estimate of the purchaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last after a busy two hours, the store grew empty for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilfred,&rdquo; said Mr. Sellyer, turning to his chief assistant,
      &ldquo;I am going out to lunch. Keep those two books running as hard as
      you can. We&rsquo;ll try them for another day and then cut them right out.
      And I&rsquo;ll drop round to Dockem &amp; Discount, the publishers, and
      make a kick about them, and see what they&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I had lingered long enough. I drew near with the Epictetus in
      my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Sellyer, professional again in a moment.
      &ldquo;Epictetus? A charming thing. Eighteen cents. Thank you. Perhaps we
      have some other things there that might interest you. We have a few
      second-hand things in the alcove there that you might care to look at.
      There&rsquo;s an Aristotle, two volumes&mdash;a very fine thing&mdash;practically
      illegible, that you might like: and a Cicero came in yesterday&mdash;very
      choice&mdash;damaged by damp&mdash;and I think we have a Machiavelli,
      quite exceptional&mdash;practically torn to pieces, and the covers gone&mdash;a
      very rare old thing, sir, if you&rsquo;re an expert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; I said. And then from a curiosity that had been
      growing in me and that I couldn&rsquo;t resist, &ldquo;That book&mdash;Golden
      Dreams,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you seem to think it a very wonderful work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sellyer directed one of his shrewd glances at me. He knew I didn&rsquo;t
      want to buy the book, and perhaps, like lesser people, he had his off
      moments of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The publishers have unloaded
      the thing on us, and we have to do what we can. They&rsquo;re stuck with
      it, I understand, and they look to us to help them. They&rsquo;re
      advertising it largely and may pull it off. Of course, there&rsquo;s just
      a chance. One can&rsquo;t tell. It&rsquo;s just possible we may get the
      church people down on it and if so we&rsquo;re all right. But short of
      that we&rsquo;ll never make it. I imagine it&rsquo;s perfectly rotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you read it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, no!&rdquo; said the manager. His air was that of a milkman
      who is offered a glass of his own milk. &ldquo;A pretty time I&rsquo;d
      have if I tried to READ the new books. It&rsquo;s quite enough to keep
      track of them without that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those people,&rdquo; I went on, deeply perplexed, &ldquo;who
      bought the book. Won&rsquo;t they be disappointed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sellyer shook his head. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you see,
      they won&rsquo;t READ it. They never do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at any rate,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;your wife thought it a
      fine story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sellyer smiled widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not married, sir,&rdquo; he said.

    </h2>
    <p>
      That is not really his name. I merely call him that from his manner of
      talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      His specialty is telling me short anecdotes of his professional life from
      day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are told with wonderful dash and power, except for one slight
      omission, which is, that you never know what the doctor is talking about.
      Beyond this, his little stories are of unsurpassed interest&mdash;but let
      me illustrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He came into the semi-silence room of the club the other day and sat down
      beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have something or other?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoke anything?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned to me. He evidently wanted to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been having a rather peculiar experience,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Man came to me the other day&mdash;three or four weeks ago&mdash;and
      said, &lsquo;Doctor, I feel out of sorts. I believe I&rsquo;ve got so and
      so.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; I said, taking a look at him, &lsquo;been
      eating so and so, eh?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo;
      I said, &lsquo;take so and so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, off the fellow went&mdash;I thought nothing of it&mdash;simply
      wrote such and such in my note-book, such and such a date, symptoms such
      and such&mdash;prescribed such and such, and so forth, you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, perfectly, doctor,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Three days later&mdash;a ring at the bell in the evening&mdash;my
      servant came to the surgery. &lsquo;Mr. So and So is here. Very anxious to
      see you.&rsquo; &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; I went down. There he was, with
      every symptom of so and so written all over him&mdash;every symptom of it&mdash;this
      and this and this&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awful symptoms, doctor,&rdquo; I said, shaking my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they not?&rdquo; he said, quite unaware that he hadn&rsquo;t
      named any. &ldquo;There he was with every symptom, heart so and so, eyes
      so and so, pulse this&mdash;I looked at him right in the eye and I said&mdash;&lsquo;Do
      you want me to tell you the truth?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I will. You&rsquo;ve got so
      and so.&rsquo; He fell back as if shot. &lsquo;So and so!&rsquo; he
      repeated, dazed. I went to the sideboard and poured him out a drink of
      such and such. &lsquo;Drink this,&rsquo; I said. He drank it. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo;
      I said, &lsquo;listen to what I say: You&rsquo;ve got so and so. There&rsquo;s
      only one chance,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you must limit your eating and
      drinking to such and such, you must sleep such and such, avoid every form
      of such and such&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you a cordial, so many drops every
      so long, but mind you, unless you do so and so, it won&rsquo;t help you.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;All right, very good.&rsquo; Fellow promised. Off he went.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paused a minute and then resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe it&mdash;two nights later, I saw the fellow&mdash;after
      the theatre, in a restaurant&mdash;whole party of people&mdash;big plate
      of so and so in front of him&mdash;quart bottle of so and so on ice&mdash;such
      and such and so forth. I stepped over to him&mdash;tapped him on the
      shoulder: &lsquo;See here,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you won&rsquo;t obey
      my instructions, you can&rsquo;t expect me to treat you.&rsquo; I walked
      out of the place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened to him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died,&rdquo; said the doctor, in a satisfied tone. &ldquo;Died. I&rsquo;ve
      just been filling in the certificate: So and so, aged such and such, died
      of so and so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An awful disease,&rdquo; I murmured.

    <h2>
      2.&mdash;The Shattered Health of Mr. Podge
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Podge?&rdquo; I said, as I sat down in a leather
      armchair beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only meant &ldquo;How-do-you-do?&rdquo; but he rolled his big eyes
      sideways at me in his flabby face (it was easier than moving his face) and
      he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as well to-day as I was yesterday afternoon. Last
      week I was feeling pretty good part of the time, but yesterday about four
      o&rsquo;clock the air turned humid, and I don&rsquo;t feel so well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigarette?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks; I find they affect the bronchial toobes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said, and I lighted one. &ldquo;So you find the
      weather trying,&rdquo; I continued cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s too humid. It&rsquo;s up to a saturation of
      sixty-six. I&rsquo;m all right till it passes sixty-four. Yesterday
      afternoon it was only about sixty-one, and I felt fine. But after that it
      went up. I guess it must be a contraction of the epidermis pressing on
      some of the sebaceous glands, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you
      just sleep it off till it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to sleep too much,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid of it developing into hypersomnia. There are cases where it&rsquo;s
      been known to grow into a sort of lethargy that pretty well stops all
      brain action altogether&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be too bad,&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;What do you do to
      prevent it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I generally drink from half to three-quarters of a cup of black
      coffee, or nearly black, every morning at from eleven to five minutes
      past, so as to keep off hypersomnia. It&rsquo;s the best thing, the doctor
      says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of its keeping you
      awake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered Podge, and a spasm passed over his big yellow
      face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always afraid of insomnia. That&rsquo;s the worst
      thing of all. The other night I went to bed about half-past ten, or
      twenty-five minutes after,&mdash;I forget which,&mdash;and I simply couldn&rsquo;t
      sleep. I couldn&rsquo;t. I read a magazine story, and I still couldn&rsquo;t;
      and I read another, and still I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. It scared me bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think sleep matters
      as long as one eats properly and has a good appetite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head very dubiously. &ldquo;I ate a plate of soup at lunch,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;and I feel it still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You FEEL it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Podge, rolling his eyes sideways in a pathetic
      fashion that he had, &ldquo;I still feel it. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have
      eaten it. It was some sort of a bean soup, and of course it was full of
      nitrogen. I oughtn&rsquo;t to touch nitrogen,&rdquo; he added, shaking his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not take any nitrogen?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the doctor&mdash;both doctors&mdash;have told me that. I can
      eat starches, and albumens, all right, but I have to keep right away from
      all carbons and nitrogens. I&rsquo;ve been dieting that way for two years,
      except that now and again I take a little glucose or phosphates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a nice change,&rdquo; I said, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he answered in a grateful sort of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. I looked at his big twitching face, and listened to the
      heavy wheezing of his breath, and I felt sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Podge,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I want to give you some good
      advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your health.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, do,&rdquo; he said. Advice about his health was right in
      his line. He lived on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, cut out all this fool business of diet and drugs and
      nitrogen. Don&rsquo;t bother about anything of the sort. Forget it. Eat
      everything you want to, just when you want it. Drink all you like. Smoke
      all you can&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll feel a new man in a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, do you think so!&rdquo; he panted, his eyes filled with a new
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; I answered. And as I left him I shook hands with
      a warm feeling about my heart of being a benefactor to the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, sure enough, Podge&rsquo;s usual chair at the club was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out getting some decent exercise,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;Thank
      Heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he come the next day, nor the next, nor for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leading a rational life at last,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;Out in
      the open getting a little air and sunlight, instead of sitting here
      howling about his stomach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after that I saw Dr. Slyder in black clothes glide into the club
      in that peculiar manner of his, like an amateur undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Slyder,&rdquo; I called to him, &ldquo;you look as solemn as
      if you had been to a funeral.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said very quietly, and then added, &ldquo;poor
      Podge!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; I asked with sudden apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he died on Tuesday,&rdquo; answered the doctor. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t
      you heard? Strangest case I&rsquo;ve known in years. Came home suddenly
      one day, pitched all his medicines down the kitchen sink, ordered a couple
      of cases of champagne and two hundred havanas, and had his housekeeper
      cook a dinner like a Roman banquet! After being under treatment for two
      years! Lived, you know, on the narrowest margin conceivable. I told him
      and Silk told him&mdash;we all told him&mdash;his only chance was to keep
      away from every form of nitrogenous ultra-stimulants. I said to him often,
      &lsquo;Podge, if you touch heavy carbonized food, you&rsquo;re lost.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;there ARE such things
      after all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a marvel,&rdquo; continued Slyder, &ldquo;that we kept him
      alive at all. And, of course&rdquo;&mdash;here the doctor paused to ring
      the bell to order two Manhattan cocktails&mdash;&ldquo;as soon as he
      touched alcohol he was done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was the end of the valetudinarianism of Mr. Podge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always considered that I killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But anyway, he was a nuisance at the club.

    <h2>
      3.&mdash;The Amazing Travels of Mr. Yarner
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was no fault to be found with Mr. Yarner till he made his trip
      around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that, I think, which disturbed his brain and unfitted him for
      membership in the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he would say, as he sat ponderously down with the air
      of a man opening an interesting conversation, &ldquo;I was just figuring
      it out that eleven months ago to-day I was in Pekin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I was just reckoning that
      eleven days ago I was in Poughkeepsie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t call it Pekin over there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      sounded Pei-Chang.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same way with
      Poughkeepsie, they pronounce it P&rsquo;Keepsie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chinese,&rdquo; he went on musingly, &ldquo;are a strange
      people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are the people in P&rsquo;Keepsie,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;awfully
      strange.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That kind of retort would sometimes stop him, but not always. He was
      especially dangerous if he was found with a newspaper in his hand; because
      that meant that some item of foreign intelligence had gone to his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that I should have objected to Yarner describing his travels. Any man
      who has bought a ticket round the world and paid for it, is entitled to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was his manner of discussion that I considered unpermissible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last week, for example, in an unguarded moment I fell a victim. I had been
      guilty of the imprudence&mdash;I forget in what connection&mdash;of
      speaking of lions. I realized at once that I had done wrong&mdash;lions,
      giraffes, elephants, rickshaws and natives of all brands, are topics to
      avoid in talking with a traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of lions,&rdquo; began Yarner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right, of course; I HAD spoken of lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;I shall never forget,&rdquo; he went on (of course, I knew
      he never would), &ldquo;a rather bad scrape I got into in the up-country
      of Uganda. Imagine yourself in a wild, rolling country covered here and
      there with kwas along the sides of the nullahs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Yarner, &ldquo;we were sitting in our tent
      one hot night&mdash;too hot to sleep&mdash;when all at once we heard, not
      ten feet in front of us, the most terrific roar that ever came from the
      throat of a lion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this Yarner paused to take a gulp of bubbling whiskey and soda
      and looked at me so ferociously that I actually shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then quite suddenly his manner cooled down in the strangest way, and his
      voice changed to a commonplace tone as he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to explain that we hadn&rsquo;t come up to the
      up-country looking for big game. In fact, we had been down in the down
      country with no idea of going higher than Mombasa. Indeed, our going even
      to Mombasa itself was more or less an afterthought. Our first plan was to
      strike across from Aden to Singapore. But our second plan was to strike
      direct from Colombo to Karuchi&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was your THIRD plan?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our third plan,&rdquo; said Yarner deliberately, feeling that the
      talk was now getting really interesting, &ldquo;let me see, our third plan
      was to cut across from Socotra to Tananarivo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, all that was changed, and changed under the strangest
      circumstances. We were sitting, Gallon and I, on the piazza of the Galle
      Face Hotel in Colombo&mdash;you know the Galle Face?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; I said very positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Well, I was sitting on the piazza watching a snake
      charmer who was seated, with a boa, immediately in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Gallon was actually within two feet of the hideous reptile.
      All of a sudden the beast whirled itself into a coil, its eyes fastened
      with hideous malignity on poor Gallon, and with its head erect it emitted
      the most awful hiss I have heard proceed from the mouth of any living
      snake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Yarner paused and took a long, hissing drink of whiskey and soda: and
      then as the malignity died out of his face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should explain,&rdquo; he went on, very quietly, &ldquo;that
      Gallon was not one of our original party. We had come down to Colombo from
      Mongolia, going by the Pekin Hankow and the Nippon Yushen Keisha.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, I suppose, is the best way?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And oddly enough but for the accident of Gallon joining us, we
      should have gone by the Amoy, Cochin, Singapore route, which was our first
      plan. In fact, but for Gallon we should hardly have got through China at
      all. The Boxer insurrection had taken place only fourteen years before our
      visit, so you can imagine the awful state of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our meeting with Gallon was thus absolutely providential. Looking
      back on it, I think it perhaps saved our lives. We were in Mongolia (this,
      you understand, was before we reached China), and had spent the night at a
      small Yak about four versts from Kharbin, when all of a sudden, just
      outside the miserable hut that we were in, we heard a perfect fusillade of
      shots followed immediately afterwards by one of the most blood-curdling
      and terrifying screams I have ever imagined&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and that was how you met Gallon.
      Well, I must be off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I happened at that very moment to be rescued by an incoming friend,
      who took but little interest in lions, and even less in Yarner, I have
      still to learn why the lion howled so when it met Yarner. But surely the
      lion had reason enough.

    <h2>
      4.&mdash;The Spiritual Outlook of Mr. Doomer
    </h2>
    <p>
      One generally saw old Mr. Doomer looking gloomily out of the windows of
      the library of the club. If not there, he was to be found staring sadly
      into the embers of a dying fire in a deserted sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gloom always appeared out of place as he was one of the richest of the
      members.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cause of it,&mdash;as I came to know,&mdash;was that he was
      perpetually concerned with thinking about the next world. In fact he spent
      his whole time brooding over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I discovered this accidentally by happening to speak to him of the recent
      death of Podge, one of our fellow members.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sad,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Podge&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned Mr. Doomer, &ldquo;very shocking. He was quite
      unprepared to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to
      hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite unprepared,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I had reason to know
      it as one of his executors,&mdash;everything is confusion,&mdash;nothing
      signed,&mdash;no proper power of attorney,&mdash;codicils drawn up in
      blank and never witnessed,&mdash;in short, sir, no sense apparently of the
      nearness of his death and of his duty to be prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;poor Podge didn&rsquo;t realise
      that he was going to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Doomer with something
      like sternness, &ldquo;a man OUGHT to realise it. Every man ought to feel
      that at any moment,&mdash;one can&rsquo;t tell when,&mdash;day or night,&mdash;he
      may be called upon to meet his,&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Doomer paused here as if
      seeking a phrase&mdash;&ldquo;to meet his Financial Obligations, face to
      face. At any time, sir, he may be hurried before the Judge,&mdash;or
      rather his estate may be,&mdash;before the Judge of the probate court. It
      is a solemn thought, sir. And yet when I come here I see about me men
      laughing, talking, and playing billiards, as if there would never be a day
      when their estate would pass into the hands of their administrators and an
      account must be given of every cent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; I said, trying to fall in with his mood,
      &ldquo;death and dissolution must come to all of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      dissolved the tobacco people, and they&rsquo;ve dissolved the oil people
      and you can&rsquo;t tell whose turn it may be next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Doomer was silent a moment and then resumed, speaking in a tone of
      humility that was almost reverential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet there is a certain preparedness for death, a certain
      fitness to die that we ought all to aim at. Any man can at least think
      solemnly of the Inheritance Tax, and reflect whether by a contract inter
      vivos drawn in blank he may not obtain redemption; any man if he thinks
      death is near may at least divest himself of his purely speculative
      securities and trust himself entirely to those gold bearing bonds of the
      great industrial corporations whose value will not readily diminish or
      pass away.&rdquo; Mr. Doomer was speaking with something like religious
      rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet what does one see?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Men affected
      with fatal illness and men stricken in years occupied still with idle talk
      and amusements instead of reading the financial newspapers,&mdash;and at
      the last carried away with scarcely time perhaps to send for their brokers
      when it is already too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very sad,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and saddest of all, perhaps, is
      the sense of the irrevocability of death and the changes that must come
      after it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We were silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think of these things a great deal, Mr. Doomer?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It may be that it is something in
      my temperament, I suppose one would call it a sort of spiritual
      mindedness. But I think of it all constantly. Often as I stand here beside
      the window and see these cars go by&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated a passing
      street car&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot but realise that the time will come when
      I am no longer a managing director and wonder whether they will keep on
      trying to hold the dividend down by improving the rolling stock or will
      declare profits to inflate the securities. These mysteries beyond the
      grave fascinate me, sir. Death is a mysterious thing. Who for example will
      take my seat on the Exchange? What will happen to my majority control of
      the power company? I shudder to think of the changes that may happen after
      death in the assessment of my real estate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is all beyond our control, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; answered Mr. Doomer; &ldquo;especially of late years
      one feels that, all said and done, we are in the hands of a Higher Power,
      and that the State Legislature is after all supreme. It gives one a sense
      of smallness. It makes one feel that in these days of drastic legislation
      with all one&rsquo;s efforts the individual is lost and absorbed in the
      controlling power of the state legislature. Consider the words that are
      used in the text of the Income Tax Case, Folio Two, or the text of the
      Trans-Missouri Freight Decision, and think of the revelation they contain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Mr. Doomer still standing beside the window, musing on the vanity
      of life and on things, such as the future control of freight rates, that
      lay beyond the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed as I left him how broken and aged he had come to look. It seemed
      as if the chafings of the spirit were wearing the body that harboured it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about a month later that I learned of Mr. Doomer&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Slyder told me of it in the club one afternoon, over two cocktails in
      the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful bedside,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one of the most
      edifying that I have ever attended. I knew that Doomer was failing and of
      course the time came when I had to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Doomer,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;all that I, all that any
      medical can do for you is done; you are going to die. I have to warn you
      that it is time for other ministrations than mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; he said faintly but firmly, &lsquo;send
      for my broker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sent out and fetched Jarvis,&mdash;you know him I think,&mdash;most
      sympathetic man and yet most business-like&mdash;he does all the firm&rsquo;s
      business with the dying,&mdash;and we two sat beside Doomer holding him up
      while he signed stock transfers and blank certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once he paused and turned his eyes on Jarvis. &lsquo;Read me from
      the text of the State Inheritance Tax Statute,&rsquo; he said. Jarvis took
      the book and read aloud very quietly and simply the part at the beginning&mdash;&lsquo;Whenever
      and wheresoever it shall appear,&rsquo; down to the words, &lsquo;shall be
      no longer a subject of judgment or appeal but shall remain in perpetual
      possession.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doomer listened with his eyes closed. The reading seemed to bring
      him great comfort. When Jarvis ended he said with a sign, &lsquo;That
      covers it. I&rsquo;ll put my faith in that.&rsquo; After that he was
      silent a moment and then said: &lsquo;I wish I had already crossed the
      river. Oh, to have already crossed the river and be safe on the other
      side.&rsquo; We knew what he meant. He had always planned to move over to
      New Jersey. The inheritance tax is so much more liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently it was all done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it is finished now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;there is still one thing.
      Doctor, you&rsquo;ve been very good to me. I should like to pay your
      account now without it being a charge on the estate. I will pay it as&rsquo;&mdash;he
      paused for a moment and a fit of coughing seized him, but by an effort of
      will he found the power to say&mdash;&lsquo;cash.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the account from my pocket (I had it with me, fearing the
      worst), and we laid his cheque-book before him on the bed. Jarvis thinking
      him too faint to write tried to guide his hand as he filled in the sum.
      But he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The room is getting dim,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I can see
      nothing but the figures.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Jarvis,&mdash;much moved, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      enough.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is it four hundred and thirty?&rsquo; he asked faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, and I could feel the tears rising in my
      eyes, &lsquo;and fifty cents.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After signing the cheque his mind wandered for a moment and he fell
      to talking, with his eyes closed, of the new federal banking law, and of
      the prospect of the reserve associations being able to maintain an
      adequate gold supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just at the last he rallied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want,&rsquo; he said in quite a firm voice, &lsquo;to do
      something for both of you before I die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are both interested, are you not,&rsquo; he murmured, in
      City Traction?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; we said. We knew of course that he was the
      managing director.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked at us faintly and tried to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Give him a cordial,&rsquo; said Jarvis. But he found his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The value of that stock,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is going to
      take a sudden&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His voice grew faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; I whispered, bending over him (there were
      tears in both our eyes), &lsquo;tell me is it going up, or going down?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is going&rsquo;&mdash;he murmured,&mdash;then his eyes
      closed&mdash;&lsquo;it is going&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;which?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is going&rsquo;&mdash;he repeated feebly and then, quite
      suddenly he fell back on the pillows and his soul passed. And we never
      knew which way it was going. It was very sad. Later on, of course, after
      he was dead, we knew, as everybody knew, that it went down.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      5.&mdash;The Reminiscences of Mr. Apricot
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a cold day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said as I entered the
      club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man I addressed popped his head out from behind a newspaper and I saw
      it was old Mr. Apricot. So I was sorry that I had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so cold as the winter of 1866,&rdquo; he said, beaming with
      benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an egg-shaped head, bald, with some white hair fluffed about the
      sides of it. He had a pink face with large blue eyes, behind his
      spectacles, benevolent to the verge of imbecility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that a cold winter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bitter cold,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never told you, have I,
      of my early experiences in life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard you mention them,&rdquo; I murmured, but he
      had already placed a detaining hand on my sleeve. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo;
      he said. Then he continued: &ldquo;Yes, it was a cold winter. I was going
      to say that it was the coldest I have ever experienced, but that might be
      an exaggeration. But it was certainly colder than any winter that YOU have
      ever seen, or that we ever have now, or are likely to have. In fact the
      winters NOW are a mere nothing,&rdquo;&mdash;here Mr. Apricot looked
      toward the club window where the driven snow was beating in eddies against
      the panes,&mdash;&ldquo;simply nothing. One doesn&rsquo;t feel them at
      all,&rdquo;&mdash;here he turned his eyes towards the glowing fire that
      flamed in the open fireplace. &ldquo;But when I was a boy things were very
      different. I have probably never mentioned to you, have I, the
      circumstances of my early life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, many times. But he had turned upon me the full beam of his
      benevolent spectacles and I was too weak to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; went on Mr. Apricot, settling back in his chair
      and speaking with a far-away look in his eyes, &ldquo;had settled on the
      banks of the Wabash River&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know it well,&rdquo; I interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as it was THEN,&rdquo; said Mr. Apricot very quickly. &ldquo;At
      present as you, or any other thoughtless tourist sees it, it appears a
      broad river pouring its vast flood in all directions. At the time I speak
      of it was a mere stream scarcely more than a few feet in circumference.
      The life we led there was one of rugged isolation and of sturdy
      self-reliance and effort such as it is, of course, quite impossible for
      YOU, or any other member of this club to understand,&mdash;I may give you
      some idea of what I mean when I say that at that time there was no town
      nearer to Pittsburgh than Chicago, or to St. Paul than Minneapolis&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Apricot seemed not to notice the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no place nearer to Springfield than St. Louis,&rdquo; he
      went on in a peculiar singsong voice, &ldquo;and there was nothing nearer
      to Denver than San Francisco, nor to New Orleans than Rio Janeiro&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed as if he would go on indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were speaking of your father?&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said Mr. Apricot, &ldquo;had settled on the
      banks, both banks, of the Wabash. He was like so many other men of his
      time, a disbanded soldier, a veteran&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the Mexican War or of the Civil War?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; answered Mr. Apricot, hardly heeding the question,&mdash;&ldquo;of
      the Mexican Civil War.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he under Lincoln?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OVER Lincoln,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Apricot gravely. And he added,&mdash;&ldquo;It
      is always strange to me the way in which the present generation regards
      Abraham Lincoln. To us, of course, at the time of which I speak, Lincoln
      was simply one of ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 1866?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was 1856,&rdquo; said Mr. Apricot. &ldquo;He came often to my
      father&rsquo;s cabin, sitting down with us to our humble meal of potatoes
      and whiskey (we lived with a simplicity which of course you could not
      possibly understand), and would spend the evening talking with my father
      over the interpretation of the Constitution of the United States. We
      children used to stand beside them listening open-mouthed beside the fire
      in our plain leather night-gowns. I shall never forget how I was thrilled
      when I first heard Lincoln lay down his famous theory of the territorial
      jurisdiction of Congress as affected by the Supreme Court decision of
      1857. I was only nine years old at the time, but it thrilled me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;how ever could you
      understand it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Apricot, almost sadly, &ldquo;in
      THOSE days the youth of the United States were EDUCATED in the real sense
      of the word. We children followed the decisions of the Supreme Court with
      breathless interest. Our books were few but they were GOOD. We had nothing
      to read but the law reports, the agriculture reports, the weather
      bulletins and the almanacs. But we read them carefully from cover to
      cover. How few boys have the industry to do so now, and yet how many of
      our greatest men were educated on practically nothing else except the law
      reports and the almanacs. Franklin, Jefferson, Jackson, Johnson,&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
      Apricot had relapsed into his sing-song voice, and his eye had a sort of
      misty perplexity in it as he went on,&mdash;&ldquo;Harrison, Thomson,
      Peterson, Emerson&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it better to stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were speaking,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of the winter of
      eighteen fifty-six.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of eighteen forty-six,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Apricot. &ldquo;I shall
      never forget it. How distinctly I remember,&mdash;I was only a boy then,
      in fact a mere lad,&mdash;fighting my way to school. The snow lay in some
      places as deep as ten feet&rdquo;&mdash; Mr. Apricot paused&mdash;&ldquo;and
      in others twenty. But we made our way to school in spite of it. No boys of
      to-day,&mdash;nor, for the matter of that, even men such as you,&mdash;would
      think of attempting it. But we were keen, anxious to learn. Our school was
      our delight. Our teacher was our friend. Our books were our companions. We
      gladly trudged five miles to school every morning and seven miles back at
      night, did chores till midnight, studied algebra by candlelight&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Mr. Apricot&rsquo;s voice had fallen into its characteristic sing-song,
      and his eyes were vacant&mdash;&ldquo;rose before daylight, dressed by
      lamplight, fed the hogs by lantern-light, fetched the cows by twilight&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it best to stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did eventually get off the farm, did you not?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;my opportunity presently came to me
      as it came in those days to any boy of industry and intelligence who
      knocked at the door of fortune till it opened. I shall never forget how my
      first chance in life came to me. A man, an entire stranger, struck no
      doubt with the fact that I looked industrious and willing, offered me a
      dollar to drive a load of tan bark to the nearest market&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minneapolis, seven hundred miles. But I did it. I shall never
      forget my feelings when I found myself in Minneapolis with one dollar in
      my pocket and with the world all before me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Mr. Apricot, &ldquo;I laid out seventy-five
      cents for a suit of clothes (things were cheap in those days); for fifty
      cents I bought an overcoat, for twenty-five I got a hat, for ten cents a
      pair of boots, and with the rest of my money I took a room for a month
      with a Swedish family, paid a month&rsquo;s board with a German family,
      arranged to have my washing done by an Irish family, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, Mr. Apricot&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point the young man who is generally in attendance on old Mr.
      Apricot when he comes to the club, appeared on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said to me aside as Mr. Apricot was
      gathering up his newspapers and his belongings, &ldquo;that my uncle has
      been rather boring you with his reminiscences.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been telling me all
      about his early life in his father&rsquo;s cabin on the Wabash&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid so,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Too bad. You see
      he wasn&rsquo;t really there at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He only fancies that he was. He was brought up in New York, and
      has never been west of Philadelphia. In fact he has been very well to do
      all his life. But he found that it counted against him: it hurt him in
      politics. So he got into the way of talking about the Middle West and
      early days there, and sometimes he forgets that he wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mr. Apricot was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye,&rdquo; he said very cheerily,&mdash;&ldquo;A
      delightful chat. We must have another talk over old times soon. I must
      tell you about my first trip over the Plains at the time when I was
      surveying the line of the Union Pacific. You who travel nowadays in your
      Pullman coaches and observation cars can have no idea&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, uncle,&rdquo; said the young man.

    <h2>
      6.&mdash;The Last Man out of Europe
    </h2>
    <p>
      He came into the club and shook hands with me as if he hadn&rsquo;t seen
      me for a year. In reality I had seen him only eleven months ago, and hadn&rsquo;t
      thought of him since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Parkins?&rdquo; I said in a guarded tone, for I saw at
      once that there was something special in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cig?&rdquo; he said as he sat down on the edge of an
      arm-chair, dangling his little boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any young man who calls a cigarette a &ldquo;cig&rdquo; I despise. &ldquo;No,
      thanks,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try one,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re Hungarian. They&rsquo;re
      some I managed to bring through with me out of the war zone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said &ldquo;war zone,&rdquo; his face twisted up into a sort of
      scowl of self-importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Parkins more closely and I noticed that he had on some sort of
      foolish little coat, short in the back, and the kind of bow-tie that they
      wear in the Hungarian bands of the Sixth Avenue restaurants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I knew what the trouble was. He was the last man out of Europe, that
      is to say, the latest last man. There had been about fourteen others in
      the club that same afternoon. In fact they were sitting all over it in
      Italian suits and Viennese overcoats, striking German matches on the soles
      of Dutch boots. These were the &ldquo;war zone&rdquo; men and they had
      just got out &ldquo;in the clothes they stood up in.&rdquo; Naturally they
      hated to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I knew all that this young man, Parkins, was going to say, and all
      about his adventures before he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we were caught right in the war zone.
      By Jove, I never want to go through again what I went through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, he sank back into the chair in the pose of a man musing in
      silence over the recollection of days of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I let him muse. In fact I determined to let him muse till he burst before
      I would ask him what he had been through. I knew it, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he decided to go on talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were at Izzl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the Carpathians, Loo
      Jones and I. We&rsquo;d just made a walking tour from Izzl to Fryzzl and
      back again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come back?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to Izzl,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;after you&rsquo;d once got
      to Fryzzl. It seems unnecessary, but, never mind, go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was in July,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a
      sign of war, not a sign. We heard that Russia was beginning to mobilize,&rdquo;
      (at this word be blew a puff from his cigarette and then repeated &ldquo;beginning
      to mobilize&rdquo;) &ldquo;but we thought nothing of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we heard that Hungary was calling out the Honveds, but we
      still thought nothing of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then we heard&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you heard that Italy was calling
      out the Trombonari, and that Germany was calling in all the
      Landesgeschutzshaft.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard it over here,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;next thing we knew we heard that
      the Russians were at Fryzzl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at Fryzzl, not a hundred miles away. The very place we&rsquo;d
      been at only two weeks before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d been where you
      were two weeks after you were there, or if the Russians had been a hundred
      miles away from where they were, or even if Fryzzl had been a hundred
      miles nearer to Izzl&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We both shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a close call,&rdquo; said Parkins. &ldquo;However, I said to
      Loo Jones, &lsquo;Loo, it&rsquo;s time to clear out.&rsquo; And then, I
      tell you, our trouble began. First of all we couldn&rsquo;t get any money.
      We went to the bank at Izzl and tried to get them to give us American
      dollars for Hungarian paper money; we had nothing else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely refused. They said they hadn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t war dreadful?
      What on earth did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took a chance,&rdquo; said Parkins. &ldquo;Went across to the
      railway station to buy our tickets with the Hungarian money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get them?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Parkins. &ldquo;They said they&rsquo;d sell us
      tickets. But they questioned us mighty closely; asked where we wanted to
      go to, what class we meant to travel by, how much luggage we had to
      register and so on. I tell you the fellow looked at us mighty closely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in those clothes?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Parkins, &ldquo;but I guess he suspected we weren&rsquo;t
      Hungarians. You see, we couldn&rsquo;t either of us speak Hungarian. In
      fact we spoke nothing but English.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would give him a clue,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;he was civil enough in a way. We
      asked when was the next train to the sea coast, and he said there wasn&rsquo;t
      any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trains?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to the coast. The man said the reason was because there wasn&rsquo;t
      any railway to the coast. But he offered to sell us tickets to Vienna. We
      asked when the train would go and he said there wouldn&rsquo;t be one for
      two hours. So there we were waiting on that wretched little platform,&mdash;no
      place to sit down, no shade, unless one went into the waiting room itself,&mdash;for
      two mortal hours. And even then the train was an hour and a half late!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour and a half late!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; said Parkins, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what things were like
      over there. So when we got on board the train we asked a man when it was
      due to get to Vienna, and he said he hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the faintest idea. He told us to ask the conductor or one of
      the porters. No, sir, I&rsquo;ll never forget that journey through to
      Vienna,&mdash;nine mortal hours! Nothing to eat, not a bite, except just
      in the middle of the day when they managed to hitch on a dining-car for a
      while. And they warned everybody that the dining-car was only on for an
      hour and a half. Commandeered, I guess after that,&rdquo; added Parkins,
      puffing his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we got to Vienna at last. I&rsquo;ll
      never forget the scene there, station full of people, trains coming and
      going, men, even women, buying tickets, big piles of luggage being shoved
      on trucks. It gave one a great idea of the reality of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Loo Jones was getting pretty well used up with it all.
      However, we determined to see it through somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried again to get money: couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;they changed our
      Hungarian paper into Italian gold, but they refused to give us American
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoarding it?&rdquo; I hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Parkins, &ldquo;hoarding it all for the war.
      Well anyhow we got on a train for Italy and there our troubles began all
      over again:&mdash;train stopped at the frontier,&mdash;officials (fellows
      in Italian uniforms) went all through it, opening hand baggage&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hand baggage!&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, even the hand baggage. Opened it all, or a lot of it
      anyway, and scribbled chalk marks over it. Yes, and worse than that,&mdash;I
      saw them take two fellows and sling them clear off the train,&mdash;they
      slung them right out on to the platform.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; said Parkins,&mdash;&ldquo;they said they had
      no tickets. In war time you know, when they&rsquo;re mobilizing, they won&rsquo;t
      let a soul ride on a train without a ticket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infernal tyranny,&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? However, we got to Genoa at last, only to find that
      not a single one of our trunks had come with us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confiscated?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Parkins, &ldquo;the head baggage
      man (he wears a uniform, you know, in Italy just like a soldier) said it
      was because we&rsquo;d forgotten to check them in Vienna. However there we
      were waiting for twenty-four hours with nothing but our valises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right at the station?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, at a hotel. We got the trunks later. They telegraphed to Vienna
      for them and managed to get them through somehow,&mdash;in a baggage car,
      I believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after that, I suppose, you had no more trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; said Parkins, &ldquo;I should say we had. Couldn&rsquo;t
      get a steamer! They said there was none sailing out of Genoa for New York
      for three days! All cancelled, I guess, or else rigged up as cruisers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuck it out as best we could: stayed right there in the hotel.
      Poor old Jones was pretty well collapsed! Couldn&rsquo;t do anything but
      sleep and eat, and sit on the piazza of the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you got your steamer at last?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;we got it. But I never want to go
      through another voyage like that again, no sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was wrong with it?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;bad weather?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, calm, but a peculiar calm, glassy, with little ripples on the
      water,&mdash;uncanny sort of feeling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was wrong with the voyage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just the feeling of it,&mdash;everything under strict rule you
      know&mdash;no lights anywhere except just the electric lights,&mdash;smoking-room
      closed tight at eleven o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;decks all washed down every
      night&mdash;officers up on the bridge all day looking out over the sea,&mdash;no,
      sir, I want no more of it. Poor old Loo Jones, I guess he&rsquo;s quite
      used up: he can&rsquo;t speak of it at all: just sits and broods, in fact
      I doubt...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Parkins&rsquo;s conversation was interrupted by the entry
      of two newcomers into the room. One of them had on a little Hungarian suit
      like the one Parkins wore, and was talking loudly as they came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;we were caught there fair and
      square right in the war zone. We were at Izzl in the Carpathians, poor old
      Parkins and I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Loo Jones, describing his escape from Europe.

    <h2>
      7.&mdash;The War Mania of Mr. Jinks and Mr. Blinks
    </h2>
    <p>
      They were sitting face to face at a lunch table at the club so near to me
      that I couldn&rsquo;t avoid hearing what they said. In any case they are
      both stout men with gurgling voices which carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Kitchener ought to do,&rdquo;&mdash;Jinks was saying in a loud
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I knew at once that he had the prevailing hallucination. He thought he
      was commanding armies in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which I watched him show with three bits of bread and two olives and
      a dessert knife the way in which the German army could be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinks looked at Jinks&rsquo; diagram with a stern impassive face,
      modelled on the Sunday supplement photogravures of Lord Kitchener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your flank would be too much exposed,&rdquo; he said, pointing to
      Jinks&rsquo; bread. He spoke with the hard taciturnity of a Joffre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reserves cover it,&rdquo; said Jinks, moving two pepper pots to
      the support of the bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; Jinks went on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say Kitchener
      WILL do this: I say this is what he OUGHT to do: it&rsquo;s exactly the
      tactics of Kuropatkin outside of Mukden and it&rsquo;s precisely the same
      turning movement that Grant used before Richmond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinks nodded gravely. Anybody who has seen the Grand Duke Nicholoevitch
      quietly accepting the advice of General Ruski under heavy artillery fire,
      will realize Blinks&rsquo; manner to a nicety.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, oddly enough, neither of them, I am certain, has ever had any larger
      ideas about the history of the Civil War than what can be got from reading
      Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin and seeing Gillette play Secret Service. But this
      is part of the mania. Jinks and Blinks had suddenly developed the
      hallucination that they knew the history of all wars by a sort of
      instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose soon after that, dusted off their waistcoats with their napkins
      and waddled heavily towards the door. I could hear them as they went
      talking eagerly of the need of keeping the troops in hard training. They
      were almost brutal in their severity. As they passed out of the door,&mdash;one
      at a time to avoid crowding,&mdash;they were still talking about it. Jinks
      was saying that our whole generation is overfed and soft. If he had his
      way he would take every man in the United States up to forty- seven years
      of age (Jinks is forty-eight) and train him to a shadow. Blinks went
      further. He said they should be trained hard up to fifty. He is fifty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I used to notice Jinks and Blinks always together in the club,
      and always carrying on the European War.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never knew which side they were on. They seemed to be on both. One day
      they commanded huge armies of Russians, and there was one week when Blinks
      and Jinks at the head of vast levies of Cossacks threatened to overrun the
      whole of Western Europe. It was dreadful to watch them burning churches
      and monasteries and to see Jinks throw whole convents full of white robed
      nuns into the flames like so much waste paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time I feared they would obliterate civilization itself. Then
      suddenly Blinks decided that Jinks&rsquo; Cossacks were no good, not
      properly trained. He converted himself on the spot into a Prussian Field
      Marshal, declared himself organised to a pitch of organisation of which
      Jinks could form no idea, and swept Jinks&rsquo; army off the earth,
      without using any men at all, by sheer organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they moved to and fro all winter over the map of Europe,
      carrying death and destruction everywhere and revelling in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I think I liked best the wild excitement of their naval battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks generally fancied himself a submarine and Blinks acted the part of a
      first-class battleship. Jinks would pop his periscope out of the water,
      take a look at Blinks merely for the fraction of a second, and then, like
      a flash, would dive under water again and start firing his torpedoes. He
      explained that he carried six.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was never quick enough for Blinks. One glimpse of his periscope
      miles and miles away was enough. Blinks landed him a contact shell in the
      side, sunk him with all hands, and then lined his yards with men and
      cheered. I have known Blinks sink Jinks at two miles, six miles&mdash;and
      once&mdash;in the club billiard room just after the battle of the Falkland
      Islands,&mdash;he got him fair and square at ten nautical miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinks of course claimed that he was not sunk. He had dived. He was two
      hundred feet under water quietly smiling at Blinks through his periscope.
      In fact the number of things that Jinks has learned to do through his
      periscope passes imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I see him looking across at Blinks with his eyes half closed and
      with a baffling, quizzical expression in them, I know that he is looking
      at him through his periscope. Now is the time for Blinks to watch out. If
      he relaxes his vigilance for a moment he&rsquo;ll be torpedoed as he sits,
      and sent flying, whiskey and soda and all, through the roof of the club,
      while Jinks dives into the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it has come about of late, I don&rsquo;t know just how, that Jinks
      has more or less got command of the sea. A sort of tacit understanding has
      been reached that Blinks, whichever army he happens at the moment to
      command, is invincible on land. But Jinks, whether as a submarine or a
      battleship, controls the sea. No doubt this grew up in the natural
      evolution of their conversation. It makes things easier for both. Jinks
      even asks Blinks how many men there are in an army division, and what a
      sotnia of Cossacks is and what the Army Service Corps means. And Jinks in
      return has become a recognized expert in torpedoes and has taken to
      wearing a blue serge suit and referring to Lord Beresford as Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I noticed chiefly about the war mania of Jinks and Blinks was
      their splendid indifference to slaughter. They had gone into the war with
      a grim resolution to fight it out to a finish. If Blinks thought to
      terrify Jinks by threatening to burn London, he little knew his man.
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jinks, taking a fresh light for his cigar,
      &ldquo;burn it! By doing so, you destroy, let us say, two million of my
      women and children? Very good. Am I injured by that? No. You merely
      stimulate me to recruiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something awful in the grimness of the struggle as carried on by
      Blinks and Jinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rights of neutrals and non-combatants, Red Cross nurses, and
      regimental clergymen they laughed to scorn. As for moving-picture men and
      newspaper correspondents, Jinks and Blinks hanged them on every tree in
      Belgium and Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      With combatants in this frame of mind the war I suppose might have lasted
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it came to an end accidentally,&mdash;fortuitously, as all great wars
      are apt to. And by accident also, I happened to see the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late one evening. Jinks and Blinks were coming down the steps of
      the club, and as they came they were speaking with some vehemence on their
      favourite topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; Jinks was saying, &ldquo;war is a great thing.
      We needed it, Blinks. We were all getting too soft, too scared of
      suffering and pain. We wilt at a bayonet charge, we shudder at the thought
      of wounds. Bah!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what does it matter if a few
      hundred thousands of human beings are cut to pieces. We need to get back
      again to the old Viking standard, the old pagan ideas of suffering&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke he got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps of the club were slippery with the evening&rsquo;s rain,&mdash;not
      so slippery as the frozen lakes of East Prussia or the hills where Jinks
      and Blinks had been campaigning all winter, but slippery enough for a
      stout man whose nation has neglected his training. As Jinks waved his
      stick in the air to illustrate the glory of a bayonet charge, he slipped
      and fell sideways on the stone steps. His shin bone smacked against the
      edge of the stone in a way that was pretty well up to the old Viking
      standard of such things. Blinks with the shock of the collision fell also,&mdash;backwards
      on the top step, his head striking first. He lay, to all appearance, as
      dead as the most insignificant casualty in Servia.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched the waiters carrying them into the club, with that new field
      ambulance attitude towards pain which is getting so popular. They had
      evidently acquired precisely the old pagan attitude that Blinks and Jinks
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the evening after that I saw Blinks and Jinks, both more or less
      bandaged, sitting in a corner of the club beneath a rubber tree, making
      peace.
    </p>

      Jinks was moving out of Montenegro and Blinks was foregoing all claims to
      Polish Prussia; Jinks was offering Alsace-Lorraine to Blinks, and Blinks
      in a fit of chivalrous enthusiasm was refusing to take it. They were
      disbanding troops, blowing up fortresses, sinking their warships and
      offering indemnities which they both refused to take. Then as they talked,
      Jinks leaned forward and said something to Blinks in a low voice,&mdash;a
      final proposal of terms evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinks nodded, and Jinks turned and beckoned to a waiter, with the words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One Scotch whiskey and soda, and one stein of Wurtemburger Bier&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when I heard this, I knew that the war was over.

    <h2>
      8.&mdash;The Ground Floor
    </h2>
    <p>
      I hadn&rsquo;t seen Ellesworth since our college days, twenty years
      before, at the time when he used to borrow two dollars and a half from the
      professor of Public Finance to tide him over the week end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then quite suddenly he turned up at the club one day and had afternoon tea
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      His big clean shaven face had lost nothing of its impressiveness, and his
      spectacles had the same glittering magnetism as in the days when he used
      to get the college bursar to accept his note of hand for his fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was still talking European politics just as he used to in the days
      of our earlier acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words,&rdquo; he said across the little tea-table, with one
      of the most piercing glances I have ever seen, &ldquo;the whole Balkan
      situation was only a beginning. We are on the eve of a great pan-Slavonic
      upheaval.&rdquo; And then he added, in a very quiet, casual tone: &ldquo;By
      the way, could you let me have twenty-five dollars till to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pan-Slavonic movement!&rdquo; I ejaculated. &ldquo;Do you really
      think it possible? No, I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; Ellesworth went on, &ldquo;Russia means
      to reach out and take all she can get;&rdquo; and he added, &ldquo;how
      about fifteen till Friday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may reach for it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I doubt if she&rsquo;ll
      get anything. I&rsquo;m sorry. I haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting the Bulgarian element,&rdquo; he continued,
      his animation just as eager as before. &ldquo;The Slavs never forget what
      they owe to one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Ellesworth drank a sip of tea and then said quietly, &ldquo;Could you
      make it ten till Saturday at twelve?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him more closely. I noticed now his frayed cuffs and the
      dinginess of his over-brushed clothes. Not even the magnetism of his
      spectacles could conceal it. Perhaps I had been forgetting something,
      whether the Bulgarian element or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I compromised at ten dollars till Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Slav,&rdquo; said Ellesworth, as he pocketed the money, &ldquo;is
      peculiar. He never forgets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing now?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;Are you still in
      insurance?&rdquo; I had a vague recollection of him as employed in that
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I gave it up. I didn&rsquo;t like
      the outlook. It was too narrow. The atmosphere cramped me. I want,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;a bigger horizon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; I answered quietly. I had known men before who had
      lost their jobs. It is generally the cramping of the atmosphere that does
      it. Some of them can use up a tremendous lot of horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present,&rdquo; Ellesworth went on, &ldquo;I am in finance. I&rsquo;m
      promoting companies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said. I had seen companies promoted before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; continued Ellesworth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on
      a thing that I think will be rather a big thing. I shouldn&rsquo;t want it
      talked about outside, but it&rsquo;s a matter of taking hold of the cod
      fisheries of the Grand Banks,&mdash;practically amalgamating them&mdash;and
      perhaps combining with them the entire herring output, and the whole of
      the sardine catch of the Mediterranean. If it goes through,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I shall be in a position to let you in on the ground floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew the ground floor of old. I have already many friends sitting on it;
      and others who have fallen through it into the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; and he left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Ellesworth, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said a friend of mine
      who was near me. &ldquo;Poor devil. I knew him slightly,&mdash;always full
      of some new and wild idea of making money. He was talking to me the other
      day of the possibility of cornering all the huckleberry crop and making
      refined sugar. Isn&rsquo;t it amazing what fool ideas fellows like him are
      always putting up to business men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I didn&rsquo;t see Ellesworth for some weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I met him in the club again. How he paid his fees there I do not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he was seated among a litter of foreign newspapers with a cup of
      tea and a ten-cent package of cigarettes beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one of these cigarettes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I get them
      specially. They are milder than what we have in the club here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They certainly were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note what I say,&rdquo; Ellesworth went on. &ldquo;The French
      Republic is going to gain from now on a stability that it never had.&rdquo;
      He seemed greatly excited about it. But his voice changed to a quiet tone
      as he added, &ldquo;Could you, without inconvenience, let me have five
      dollars?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I knew that the cod-fish and the sardines were still unamalgamated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the fisheries thing?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Did it go
      through?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fisheries? No, I gave it up. I refused to go forward with it.
      The New York people concerned were too shy, too timid to tackle it. I
      finally had to put it to them very straight that they must either stop
      shilly-shallying and declare themselves, or the whole business was off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they declare themselves?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did,&rdquo; said Ellesworth, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t regret
      it. I&rsquo;m working now on a much bigger thing,&mdash;something with
      greater possibilities in it. When the right moment comes I&rsquo;ll let
      you in on the ground floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him and we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time I saw Ellesworth he told me at once that he regarded Albania
      as unable to stand by itself. So I gave him five dollars on the spot and
      left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after that he called me up on the telephone to tell me that the
      whole of Asia Minor would have to be redistributed. The redistribution
      cost me five dollars more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I met him on the street, and he said that Persia was disintegrating,
      and took from me a dollar and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I passed him next in the street he was very busy amalgamating Chinese
      tramways. It appeared that there was a ground floor in China, but I kept
      off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time I saw Ellesworth he looked a little shabbier than the last. Then
      one day he called me up on the telephone, and made an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner when I joined him was full of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you at once,&rdquo; he said in a commanding tone, &ldquo;to
      write me your cheque for a hundred dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now able,&rdquo; said Ellesworth, &ldquo;to put you in on the
      ground floor of one of the biggest things in years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the ground floor is no place for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me,&rdquo; said Ellesworth. &ldquo;This
      is a big thing. It&rsquo;s an idea I&rsquo;ve been working on for some
      time,&mdash;making refined sugar from the huckleberry crop. It&rsquo;s a
      certainty. I can get you shares now at five dollars. They&rsquo;ll go to
      five hundred when we put them on the market,&mdash;and I can run you in
      for a block of stock for promotion services as well. All you have to do is
      to give me right now a hundred dollars,&mdash;cash or your cheque,&mdash;and
      I can arrange the whole thing for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ellesworth,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t
      mind if I give you a little bit of good advice. Why not drop all this idea
      of quick money? There&rsquo;s nothing in it. The business world has grown
      too shrewd for it. Take an ordinary decent job and stick to it. Let me use
      my influence,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;to try and get you into something
      with a steady salary, and with your brains you&rsquo;re bound to get on in
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellesworth looked pained. A &ldquo;steady job&rdquo; sounded to him like a
      &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I saw nothing of him for weeks. But I didn&rsquo;t forget him.
      I looked about and secured for him a job as a canvassing agent for a book
      firm at a salary of five dollars a week, and a commission of one-tenth of
      one per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was waiting to tell him of his good luck, when I chanced to see him at
      the club again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he looked transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had on a long frock coat that reached nearly to his knees. He was
      leading a little procession of very heavy men in morning coats, upstairs
      towards the private luncheon rooms. They moved like a funeral, puffing as
      they went. I had seen company directors before and I knew what they were
      at sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small club and rather inconvenient,&rdquo; Ellesworth
      was saying, &ldquo;and the horizon of some of its members rather narrow,&rdquo;
      here he nodded to me as he passed,&mdash;&ldquo;but I can give you a
      fairly decent lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched them as they disappeared upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ellesworth, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said a man near me.
      It was the same man who had asked about him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giving a lunch to his directors, I suppose,&rdquo; said my friend;
      &ldquo;lucky dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His directors?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, hadn&rsquo;t you heard? He&rsquo;s just cleaned up half a
      million or more,&mdash;some new scheme for making refined sugar out of
      huckleberries. Isn&rsquo;t it amazing what shrewd ideas these big business
      men get hold of? They say they&rsquo;re unloading the stock at five
      hundred dollars. It only cost them about five to organize. If only one
      could get on to one of these things early enough, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assented sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next time I am offered a chance on the ground floor I am going to
      take it, even if it&rsquo;s only the barley floor of a brewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that there is such a place after all.

    <h2>
      9.&mdash;The Hallucination of Mr. Butt
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the hallucination of Mr. Butt&rsquo;s life that he lives to do good.
      At whatever cost of time or trouble to himself, he does it. Whether people
      appear to desire it or not, he insists on helping them along.
    </p>
    <p>
      His time, his company and his advice are at the service not only of those
      who seek them but of those who, in the mere appearances of things, are not
      asking for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may see the beaming face of Mr. Butt appear at the door of all those
      of his friends who are stricken with the minor troubles of life. Whenever
      Mr. Butt learns that any of his friends are moving house, buying
      furniture, selling furniture, looking for a maid, dismissing a maid,
      seeking a chauffeur, suing a plumber or buying a piano,&mdash;he is at
      their side in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when I met him one night in the cloak room of the club putting on his
      raincoat and his galoshes with a peculiar beaming look on his face, I knew
      that he was up to some sort of benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come upstairs,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and play billiards.&rdquo; I
      saw from his general appearance that it was a perfectly safe offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Butt, &ldquo;I only wish I could. I
      wish I had the time. I am sure it would cheer you up immensely if I could.
      But I&rsquo;m just going out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; I asked, for I knew he wanted me to
      say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to see the Everleigh-Joneses,&mdash;you know
      them? no?&mdash;just come to the city, you know, moving into their new
      house, out on Seldom Avenue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s away out in the suburbs, is
      it not, a mile or so beyond the car tracks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; answered Mr. Butt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s going on for ten o&rsquo;clock and it&rsquo;s
      starting to rain&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said Mr. Butt, cheerfully, adjusting his
      galoshes. &ldquo;I never mind the rain,&mdash;does one good. As to their
      house. I&rsquo;ve not been there yet but I can easily find it. I&rsquo;ve
      a very simple system for finding a house at night by merely knocking at
      the doors in the neighborhood till I get it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather late to go there?&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Butt warmly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      mind that a bit. The way I look at it is, here are these two young people,
      only married a few weeks, just moving into their new house, everything
      probably upside down, no one there but themselves, no one to cheer them
      up,&rdquo;&mdash;he was wriggling into his raincoat as he spoke and
      working himself into a frenzy of benevolence,&mdash;&ldquo;good gracious,
      I only learned at dinner time that they had come to town, or I&rsquo;d
      have been out there days ago,&mdash;days ago&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that Mr. Butt went bursting forth into the rain, his face shining
      with good will under the street lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I saw him again at the club at lunch time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;did you find the Joneses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Mr. Butt, &ldquo;and by George I was glad that I&rsquo;d
      gone&mdash;quite a lot of trouble to find the house (though I didn&rsquo;t
      mind that; I expected it)&mdash;had to knock at twenty houses at least to
      get it,&mdash;very dark and wet out there, &mdash;no street lights yet,&mdash;however
      I simply pounded at the doors until some one showed a light&mdash;at every
      house I called out the same things, &lsquo;Do you know where the Everleigh
      Joneses live?&rsquo; They didn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;go back to bed. Don&rsquo;t bother to come down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I got to the right spot at last. I found the house all dark.
      Jones put his head out of an upper window. Hullo,&rsquo; I called out;
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Butt.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve gone to bed.&rsquo; &lsquo;My dear boy,&rsquo; I
      called back, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t apologize at all. Throw me down the key
      and I&rsquo;ll wait while you dress. I don&rsquo;t mind a bit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of it,&rdquo; continued Mr. Butt, &ldquo;those two poor
      souls going to bed at half past ten, through sheer dullness! By George, I
      was glad I&rsquo;d come. &lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s
      cheer them up a little, let&rsquo;s make things a little brighter here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, down they came and we sat there on furniture cases and things
      and had a chat. Mrs. Jones wanted to make me some coffee. &lsquo;My dear
      girl,&rsquo; I said (I knew them both when they were children) &lsquo;I
      absolutely refuse. Let ME make it.&rsquo; They protested. I insisted. I
      went at it,&mdash;kitchen all upset&mdash;had to open at least twenty tins
      to get the coffee. However, I made it at last. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;drink it.&rsquo; They said they had some an hour or so ago. &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo;
      I said, &lsquo;drink it.&rsquo; Well, we sat and chatted away till
      midnight. They were dull at first and I had to do all the talking. But I
      set myself to it. I can talk, you know, when I try. Presently about
      midnight they seemed to brighten up a little. Jones looked at his watch.
      &lsquo;By Jove,&rsquo; he said, in an animated way, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      after midnight.&rsquo; I think he was pleased at the way the evening was
      going; after that we chatted away more comfortably. Every little while
      Jones would say, &lsquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s half past twelve,&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took care, of course, not to stay too late. But when I left them
      I promised that I&rsquo;d come back to-day to help straighten things up.
      They protested, but I insisted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That same day Mr. Butt went out to the suburbs and put the Joneses&rsquo;
      furniture to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I worked all afternoon,&rdquo; he told me afterwards,&mdash;&ldquo;hard
      at it with my coat off&mdash;got the pictures up first&mdash;they&rsquo;d
      been trying to put them up by themselves in the morning. I had to take
      down every one of them&mdash;not a single one right,&mdash;&lsquo;Down
      they come,&rsquo; I said, and went at it with a will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later Mr. Butt gave me a further report. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;the furniture is all unpacked and straightened out but I don&rsquo;t
      like it. There&rsquo;s a lot of it I don&rsquo;t quite like. I half feel
      like advising Jones to sell it and get some more. But I don&rsquo;t want
      to do that till I&rsquo;m quite certain about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Mr. Butt seemed much occupied and I didn&rsquo;t see him at the
      club for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the Everleigh-Joneses?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Are they
      comfortable in their new house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Butt shook his head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      was afraid of it from the first. I&rsquo;m moving Jones in nearer to town.
      I&rsquo;ve been out all morning looking for an apartment; when I get the
      right one I shall move him. I like an apartment far better than a house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Joneses in due course of time were moved. After that Mr. Butt was
      very busy selecting a piano, and advising them on wall paper and woodwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were hardly settled in their new home when fresh trouble came to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard about Everleigh-Jones?&rdquo; said Mr. Butt one day
      with an anxious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ill&mdash;some sort of fever&mdash;poor chap&mdash;been
      ill three days, and they never told me or sent for me&mdash;just like
      their grit&mdash;meant to fight it out alone. I&rsquo;m going out there at
      once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From day to day I had reports from Mr. Butt of the progress of Jones&rsquo;s
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sit with him every day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poor chap,&mdash;he
      was very bad yesterday for a while,&mdash;mind wandered&mdash;quite
      delirious&mdash;I could hear him from the next room&mdash;seemed to think
      some one was hunting him&mdash;&lsquo;Is that damn old fool gone,&rsquo; I
      heard him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went in and soothed him. &lsquo;There is no one here, my dear
      boy,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;no one, only Butt.&rsquo; He turned over and
      groaned. Mrs. Jones begged me to leave him. &lsquo;You look quite used up,&rsquo;
      she said. &lsquo;Go out into the open air.&rsquo; &lsquo;My dear Mrs.
      Jones,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what DOES it matter about me?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, thanks no doubt to Mr. Butt&rsquo;s assiduous care,
      Everleigh-Jones got well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Butt to me a few weeks later, &ldquo;Jones is
      all right again now, but his illness has been a long hard pull. I haven&rsquo;t
      had an evening to myself since it began. But I&rsquo;m paid, sir, now,
      more than paid for anything I&rsquo;ve done,&mdash;the gratitude of those
      two people&mdash;it&rsquo;s unbelievable &mdash;you ought to see it. Why
      do you know that dear little woman is so worried for fear that my strength
      has been overtaxed that she wants me to take a complete rest and go on a
      long trip somewhere&mdash;suggested first that I should go south. &lsquo;My
      dear Mrs. Jones,&rsquo; I said laughing, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the ONE place
      I will not go. Heat is the one thing I CAN&rsquo;T stand.&rsquo; She wasn&rsquo;t
      nonplussed for a moment. &lsquo;Then go north,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Go
      up to Canada, or better still go to Labrador,&rsquo;&mdash;and in a minute
      that kind little woman was hunting up railway maps to see how far north I
      could get by rail. &lsquo;After that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you can go
      on snowshoes.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s found that there&rsquo;s a steamer to
      Ungava every spring and she wants me to run up there on one steamer and
      come back on the next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very gratifying,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is, it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Butt warmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      well worth anything I do. It more than repays me. I&rsquo;m alone in the
      world and my friends are all I have. I can&rsquo;t tell you how it goes to
      my heart when I think of all my friends, here in the club and in the town,
      always glad to see me, always protesting against my little kindnesses and
      yet never quite satisfied about anything unless they can get my advice and
      hear what I have to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Jones for instance,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;&ldquo;do you
      know, really now as a fact,&mdash;the hall porter assures me of it,&mdash;every
      time Everleigh-Jones enters the club here the first thing he does is to
      sing out, &lsquo;Is Mr. Butt in the club?&rsquo; It warms me to think of
      it.&rdquo; Mr. Butt paused, one would have said there were tears in his
      eyes. But if so the kindly beam of his spectacles shone through them like
      the sun through April rain. He left me and passed into the cloak room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just left the hall when a stranger entered, a narrow, meek man with
      a hunted face. He came in with a furtive step and looked about him
      apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Butt in the club?&rdquo; he whispered to the hall porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he&rsquo;s just gone into the cloak room, sir, shall I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man had turned and made a dive for the front door and had
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new member, sir, Mr. Everleigh-Jones,&rdquo; said
      the hall porter.

    <h2>
      IV-RAM SPUDD THE NEW WORLD SINGER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Is He Divinely Inspired? Or Is He Not? At Any Rate We Discovered Him.
    </h3>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Mr. Spudd was discovered by the author for the New York Life.
      He is already recognized as superior to Tennyson and second only, as a
      writer of imagination, to the Sultan of Turkey.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of a new poet is always a joy to the cultivated world. It is
      therefore with the greatest pleasure that we are able to announce that we
      ourselves, acting quite independently and without aid from any of the
      English reviews of the day, have discovered one. In the person of Mr. Ram
      Spudd, of whose work we give specimens below, we feel that we reveal to
      our readers a genius of the first order. Unlike one of the most recently
      discovered English poets who is a Bengalee, and another who is a
      full-blooded Yak, Mr. Spudd is, we believe, a Navajo Indian. We believe
      this from the character of his verse. Mr. Spudd himself we have not seen.
      But when he forwarded his poems to our office and offered with
      characteristic modesty to sell us his entire works for seventy-five cents,
      we felt in closing with his offer that we were dealing not only with a
      poet, but with one of nature&rsquo;s gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spudd, we understand, has had no education. Other newly discovered
      poets have had, apparently, some. Mr. Spudd has had, evidently, none. We
      lay stress on this point. Without it we claim it is impossible to
      understand his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we particularly like about Ram Spudd, and we do not say this because
      we discovered him but because we believe it and must say it, is that he
      belongs not to one school but to all of them. As a nature poet we doubt
      very much if he has his equal; as a psychologist, we are sure he has not.
      As a clear lucid thinker he is undoubtedly in the first rank; while as a
      mystic he is a long way in front of it. The specimens of Mr. Spudd&rsquo;s
      verse which we append herewith were selected, we are happy to assure our
      readers, purely at random from his work. We first blindfolded ourselves
      and then, standing with our feet in warm water and having one hand tied
      behind our back, we groped among the papers on our desk before us and
      selected for our purpose whatever specimens first came to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, or did we say it, it is perhaps as a nature poet that Ram
      Spudd excels. Others of our modern school have carried the observation of
      natural objects to a high degree of very nice precision, but with Mr.
      Spudd the observation of nature becomes an almost scientific process.
      Nothing escapes him. The green of the grass he detects as in an instant.
      The sky is no sooner blue than he remarks it with unerring certainty.
      Every bird note, every bee call, is familiar to his trained ear. Perhaps
      we cannot do better than quote the opening lines of a singularly beautiful
      sample of Ram Spudd&rsquo;s genius which seems to us the last word in
      nature poetry. It is called, with characteristic daintiness&mdash;

      SPRING THAW IN THE
   AHUNTSIC WOODS, NEAR PASPEBIAC,
      PASSAMOQUODDY COUNTY
</pre>
    <p>
      (We would like to say that, to our ears at least, there is a music in this
      title like the sound of falling water, or of chopped ice. But we must not
      interrupt ourselves. We now begin. Listen.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 The thermometer is standing this morning at thirty-
   three decimal one.
 As a consequence it is freezing in the shade, but
   it is thawing in the sun.
 There is a certain amount of snow on the ground,
   but of course not too much.
 The air is what you would call humid, but not
   disagreeable to the touch.
 Where I am standing I find myself practically
   surrounded by trees,
 It is simply astonishing the number of the different
   varieties one sees.
 I&rsquo;ve grown so wise I can tell each different tree
   by seeing it glisten,
 But if that test fails I simply put my ear to the
   tree and listen,
 And, well, I suppose it is only a silly fancy of
   mine perhaps,
 But do you know I&rsquo;m getting to tell different trees
   by the sound of their saps.
 After I have noticed all the trees, and named those
   I know in words,
 I stand quite still and look all round to see if
   there are any birds,
 And yesterday, close where I was standing, sitting
   in some brush on the snow,
 I saw what I was practically absolutely certain was
   an early crow.
 I sneaked up ever so close and was nearly beside
   it, when say!
 It turned and took one look at me, and flew away.
</pre>
    <p>
      But we should not wish our readers to think that Ram Spudd is always and
      only the contemplative poet of the softer aspects of nature. Oh, by no
      means. There are times when waves of passion sweep over him in such
      prodigious volume as to roll him to and fro like a pebble in the surf.
      Gusts of emotion blow over him with such violence as to hurl him pro and
      con with inconceivable fury. In such moods, if it were not for the relief
      offered by writing verse we really do not know what would happen to him.
      His verse written under the impulse of such emotions marks him as one of
      the greatest masters of passion, wild and yet restrained, objectionable
      and yet printable, that have appeared on this side of the Atlantic. We
      append herewith a portion, or half portion, of his little gem entitled
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   YOU

   You!
 With your warm, full, rich, red, ripe lips,
 And your beautifully manicured finger-tips!
   You!
 With your heaving, panting, rapidly expanding and
   contracting chest,
 Lying against my perfectly ordinary shirt-front and
   dinner-jacket vest.
      It is too much
      Your touch
      As such.
      It and
      Your hand,
   Can you not understand?
 Last night an ostrich feather from your fragrant hair
      Unnoticed fell.
      I guard it
      Well.
      Yestere&rsquo;en
   From your tiara I have slid,
      Unseen,
      A single diamond,
      And I keep it
      Hid.
 Last night you left inside the vestibule upon the sill
      A quarter dollar,
      And I have it
      Still.
</pre>
    <p>
      But even those who know Ram Spudd as the poet of nature or of passion
      still only know a part of his genius. Some of his highest flights rise
      from an entirely different inspiration, and deal with the public affairs
      of the nation. They are in every sense comparable to the best work of the
      poets laureate of England dealing with similar themes. As soon as we had
      seen Ram Spudd&rsquo;s work of this kind, we cried, that is we said to our
      stenographer, &ldquo;What a pity that in this republic we have no
      laureateship. Here is a man who might truly fill it.&rdquo; Of the poem of
      this kind we should wish to quote, if our limits of space did not prevent
      it, Mr. Spudd&rsquo;s exquisite
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   ODE ON THE REDUCTION OF THE
      UNITED STATES TARIFF

 It is a matter of the very gravest concern to at least
   nine-tenths of the business interests in the
   United States,
 Whether an all-round reduction of the present tariff
   either on an ad valorem or a specific basis
 Could be effected without a serious disturbance of the
   general industrial situation of the country.
</pre>
    <p>
      But, no, we must not quote any more. No we really mustn&rsquo;t. Yet we
      cannot refrain from inserting a reference to the latest of these laureate
      poems of Ram Spudd. It appears to us to be a matchless specimen of its
      class, and to settle once and for all the vexed question (though we
      ourselves never vexed it) of whether true poetry can deal with national
      occasions as they arise. It is entitled:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   THE BANKER&rsquo;S EUTHANASIA: OR,
   THE FEDERAL RESERVE CURRENCY
      ACT OF 1914,
</pre>
    <p>
      and, though we do not propose to reproduce it here, our distinct feeling
      is that it will take its rank beside Mr. Spudd&rsquo;s Elegy on the
      Interstate Commerce Act, and his Thoughts on the Proposal of a Uniform
      Pure Food Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our space does not allow us to present Ram Spudd in what is after all
      his greatest aspect, that of a profound psychologist, a questioner of the
      very meaning of life itself. His poem Death and Gloom, from which we must
      refrain from quoting at large, contains such striking passages as the
      following:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Why do I breathe, or do I?
   What am I for, and whither do I go?
   What skills it if I live, and if I die,
      What boots it?
</pre>
    <p>
      Any one knowing Ram Spudd as we do will realize that these questions,
      especially the last, are practically unanswerable.

      V.&mdash;ARISTOCRATIC ANECDOTES OR LITTLE STORIES OF GREAT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PEOPLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have been much struck lately by the many excellent little anecdotes of
      celebrated people that have appeared in recent memoirs and found their way
      thence into the columns of the daily press. There is something about them
      so deliciously pointed, their humour is so exquisite, that I think we
      ought to have more of them. To this end I am trying to circulate on my own
      account a few anecdotes which seem somehow to have been overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, for example, is an excellent thing which comes, if I remember
      rightly, from the vivacious Memoir of Lady Ranelagh de Chit Chat.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ANECDOTE OF THE DUKE OF STRATHYTHAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lady Ranelagh writes:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;The Duke of Strathythan (I am writing of course of the
 seventeenth Duke, not of his present Grace) was, as
 everybody knows, famous for his hospitality.  It was not
 perhaps generally known that the Duke was as witty as he
 was hospitable. I recall a most amusing incident that
 happened the last time but two that I was staying at
 Strathythan Towers. As we sat down to lunch (we were a
 very small and intimate party, there being only forty-three
 of us) the Duke, who was at the head of the table, looked
 up from the roast of beef that he was carving, and running
 his eye about the guests was heard to murmur, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
 there isn&rsquo;t enough beef to go round.&rsquo;

 &ldquo;There was nothing to do, of course, but to roar with
 laughter and the incident passed off with perfect savoir
 faire.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here is another story which I think has not had all the publicity that it
      ought to. I found it in the book &ldquo;Shot, Shell and Shrapnell or Sixty
      Years as a War Correspondent,&rdquo; recently written by Mr. Maxim Catling
      whose exploits are familiar to all readers.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ANECDOTE OF LORD KITCHENER
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;I was standing,&rdquo; writes Mr. Maxim, &ldquo;immediately between
 Lord Kitchener and Lord Wolsley (with Lord Roberts a
 little to the rear of us), and we were laughing and
 chatting as we always did when the enemy were about to
 open fire on us. Suddenly we found ourselves the object
 of the most terrific hail of bullets. For a few moments
 the air was black with them. As they went past I could
 not refrain from exchanging a quiet smile with Lord
 Kitchener, and another with Lord Wolsley. Indeed I have
 never, except perhaps on twenty or thirty occasions,
 found myself exposed to such an awful fusillade.

 &ldquo;Kitchener, who habitually uses an eye-glass (among his
 friends), watched the bullets go singing by, and then,
 with that inimitable sangfroid which he reserves for his
 intimates, said,

 &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid if we stay here we may get hit.&rsquo;

 &ldquo;We all moved away laughing heartily.

 &ldquo;To add to the joke, Lord Roberts&rsquo; aide-de-camp was shot
 in the pit of the stomach as we went.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The next anecdote which I reproduce may be already too well known to my
      readers. The career of Baron Snorch filled so large a page in the history
      of European diplomacy that the publication of his recent memoirs was
      awaited with profound interest by half the chancelleries of Europe. (Even
      the other half were half excited over them.) The tangled skein in which
      the politics of Europe are enveloped was perhaps never better illustrated
      than in this fascinating volume. Even at the risk of repeating what is
      already familiar, I offer the following for what it is worth&mdash;or even
      less.
    </p>
    <h3>
      NEW LIGHT ON THE LIFE OF CAVOUR
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;I have always regarded Count Cavour,&rdquo; writes the Baron,
 &ldquo;as one of the most impenetrable diplomatists whom it
 has been my lot to meet. I distinctly recall an incident
 in connection with the famous Congress of Paris of 1856
 which rises before my mind as vividly as if it were
 yesterday. I was seated in one of the large salons of
 the Elysee Palace (I often used to sit there) playing
 vingt-et-un together with Count Cavour, the Duc de Magenta,
 the Marquese di Casa Mombasa, the Conte di Piccolo Pochito
 and others whose names I do not recollect. The stakes
 had been, as usual, very high, and there was a large pile
 of gold on the table. No one of us, however, paid any
 attention to it, so absorbed were we all in the thought
 of the momentous crises that were impending. At intervals
 the Emperor Napoleon III passed in and out of the room,
 and paused to say a word or two, with well-feigned
 eloignement, to the players, who replied with such
 degagement as they could.

 &ldquo;While the play was at its height a servant appeared with
 a telegram on a silver tray. He handed it to Count Cavour.
 The Count paused in his play, opened the telegram, read
 it and then with the most inconceivable nonchalance, put
 it in his pocket. We stared at him in amazement for a
 moment, and then the Duc, with the infinite ease of a
 trained diplomat, quietly resumed his play.

 &ldquo;Two days afterward, meeting Count Cavour at a reception
 of the Empress Eugenie, I was able, unobserved, to whisper
 in his ear, &lsquo;What was in the telegram?&rsquo; &lsquo;Nothing of any
 consequence,&rsquo; he answered.  From that day to this I have
 never known what it contained. My readers,&rdquo; concludes
 Baron Snorch, &ldquo;may believe this or not as they like, but
 I give them my word that it is true.

 &ldquo;Probably they will not believe it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I cannot resist appending to these anecdotes a charming little story from
      that well-known book, &ldquo;Sorrows of a Queen&rdquo;. The writer, Lady
      de Weary, was an English gentlewoman who was for many years Mistress of
      the Robes at one of the best known German courts. Her affection for her
      royal mistress is evident on every page of her memoirs.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TENDERNESS OF A QUEEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lady de W. writes:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;My dear mistress, the late Queen of Saxe-Covia-Slitz-
 in-Mein, was of a most tender and sympathetic disposition.
 The goodness of her heart broke forth on all occasions.
 I well remember how one day, on seeing a cabman in the
 Poodel Platz kicking his horse in the stomach, she stopped
 in her walk and said, &lsquo;Oh, poor horse! if he goes on
 kicking it like that he&rsquo;ll hurt it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I may say in conclusion that I think if people would only take a little
      more pains to resuscitate anecdotes of this sort, there might be a lot
      more of them found.

      VI.&mdash;EDUCATION MADE AGREEABLE OR THE DIVERSIONS OF A
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PROFESSOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      A few days ago during a pause in one of my college lectures (my class
      being asleep) I sat reading Draper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Intellectual Development
      of Europe&rdquo;. Quite suddenly I came upon the following sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eratosthenes cast everything he wished to teach into poetry. By
      this means he made it attractive, and he was able to spread his system all
      over Asia Minor.&rdquo;
    </p>

      This came to me with a shock of an intellectual discovery. I saw at once
      how I could spread my system, or parts of it, all over the United States
      and Canada. To make education attractive! There it is! To call in the help
      of poetry, of music, of grand opera, if need be, to aid in the teaching of
      the dry subjects of the college class room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set to work at once on the project and already I have enough results to
      revolutionize education.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place I have compounded a blend of modern poetry and
      mathematics, which retains all the romance of the latter and loses none of
      the dry accuracy of the former. Here is an example:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      The poem of
   LORD ULLIN&rsquo;S DAUGHTER
      expressed as
   A PROBLEM IN TRIGONOMETRY
</pre>
    <p>
      INTRODUCTION. A party of three persons, a Scotch nobleman, a young lady
      and an elderly boatman stand on the banks of a river (R), which, for
      private reasons, they desire to cross. Their only means of transport is a
      boat, of which the boatman, if squared, is able to row at a rate
      proportional to the square of the distance. The boat, however, has a leak
      (S), through which a quantity of water passes sufficient to sink it after
      traversing an indeterminate distance (D). Given the square of the boatman
      and the mean situation of all concerned, to find whether the boat will
      pass the river safely or sink.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   A chieftain to the Highlands bound
      Cried &ldquo;Boatman do not tarry!
   And I&rsquo;ll give you a silver pound
      To row me o&rsquo;er the ferry.&rdquo;
    Before them raged the angry tide
   X**2 + Y from side to side.

   Outspake the hardy Highland wight,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, my chief, I&rsquo;m ready;
   It is not for your silver bright,
      But for your winsome lady.&rdquo;
    And yet he seemed to manifest
      A certain hesitation;
   His head was sunk upon his breast
      In puzzled calculation.

   &ldquo;Suppose the river X + Y
   And call the distance Q
   Then dare we thus the gods defy
   I think we dare, don&rsquo;t you?
      Our floating power expressed in words
      Is X + 47/3&rdquo;

   &ldquo;Oh, haste thee, haste,&rdquo; the lady cries,
   &ldquo;Though tempests round us gather
   I&rsquo;ll face the raging of the skies
   But please cut out the Algebra.&rdquo;

   The boat has left the stormy shore (S)
   A stormy C before her
   C1 C2 C3 C4
   The tempest gathers o&rsquo;er her
      The thunder rolls, the lightning smites &lsquo;em
      And the rain falls ad infinitum.

   In vain the aged boatman strains,
   His heaving sides reveal his pains;
   The angry water gains apace
   Both of his sides and half his base,
      Till, as he sits, he seems to lose
      The square of his hypotenuse.

   The boat advanced to X + 2,
   Lord Ullin reached the fixed point Q,&mdash;
      Then the boat sank from human eye,
   OY, OY**2, OGY.
</pre>
    <p>
      But this is only a sample of what can be done. I have realised that all
      our technical books are written and presented in too dry a fashion. They
      don&rsquo;t make the most of themselves. Very often the situation implied
      is intensely sensational, and if set out after the fashion of an
      up-to-date newspaper, would be wonderfully effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, for example, you have Euclid writing in a perfectly prosaic way all
      in small type such an item as the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perpendicular is let fall on a line BC so as to bisect it at the
      point C etc., etc.,&rdquo; just as if it were the most ordinary occurrence
      in the world. Every newspaper man will see at once that it ought to be set
      up thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      AWFUL CATASTROPHE
   PERPENDICULAR FALLS HEADLONG
      ON A GIVEN POINT

   The Line at C said to be completely bisected
   President of the Line makes Statement
      etc., etc., etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      But I am not contenting myself with merely describing my system. I am
      putting it to the test. I am preparing a new and very special edition of
      my friend Professor Daniel Murray&rsquo;s work on the Calculus. This is a
      book little known to the general public. I suppose one may say without
      exaggeration that outside of the class room it is hardly read at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I venture to say that when my new edition is out it will be found on
      the tables of every cultivated home, and will be among the best sellers of
      the year. All that is needed is to give to this really monumental book the
      same chance that is given to every other work of fiction in the modern
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all I wrap it in what is called technically a jacket. This is of
      white enamelled paper, and on it is a picture of a girl, a very pretty
      girl, in a summer dress and sunbonnet sitting swinging on a bough of a
      cherry tree. Across the cover in big black letters are the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   THE CALCULUS
</pre>
    <p>
      and beneath them the legend &ldquo;the most daring book of the day.&rdquo;
      This, you will observe, is perfectly true. The reviewers of the
      mathematical journals when this book first came out agreed that &ldquo;Professor
      Murray&rsquo;s views on the Calculus were the most daring yet published.&rdquo;
      They said, too, that they hoped that the professor&rsquo;s unsound
      theories of infinitesimal rectitude would not remain unchallenged. Yet the
      public somehow missed it all, and one of the most profitable scandals in
      the publishing trade was missed for the lack of a little business
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      My new edition will give this book its first real chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that the inside has to be altered,&mdash;but not very much. The
      real basis of interest is there. The theories in the book are just as
      interesting as those raised in the modern novel. All that is needed is to
      adopt the device, familiar in novels, of clothing the theories in personal
      form and putting the propositions advanced into the mouths of the
      characters, instead of leaving them as unsupported statements of the
      author. Take for example Dr. Murray&rsquo;s beginning. It is very good,&mdash;any
      one will admit it,&mdash;fascinatingly clever, but it lacks heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It runs:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 If two magnitudes, one of which is determined by a straight
 line and the other by a parabola approach one another,
 the rectangle included by the revolution of each will be
 equal to the sum of a series of indeterminate rectangles.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now this is,&mdash;quite frankly,&mdash;dull. The situation is there; the
      idea is good, and, whether one agrees or not, is at least as brilliantly
      original as even the best of our recent novels. But I find it necessary to
      alter the presentation of the plot a little bit. As I re-edit it the
      opening of the Calculus runs thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 On a bright morning in June along a path gay with the
 opening efflorescence of the hibiscus and entangled here
 and there with the wild blossoms of the convolvulus,&mdash;two
 magnitudes might have been seen approaching one another.
 The one magnitude who held a tennis-racket in his hand,
 carried himself with a beautiful erectness and moved
 with a firmness such as would have led Professor Murray
 to exclaim in despair&mdash;Let it be granted that A. B.
 (for such was our hero&rsquo;s name) is a straight line. The
 other magnitude, which drew near with a step at once
 elusive and fascinating, revealed as she walked a figure
 so exquisite in its every curve as to call from her
 geometrical acquaintances the ecstatic exclamation, &ldquo;Let
 it be granted that M is a parabola.&rdquo;

 The beautiful magnitude of whom we have last spoken,
 bore on her arm as she walked, a tiny dog over which
 her fair head was bent in endearing caresses; indeed
 such was her attention to the dog Vi (his full name was
 Velocity but he was called Vi for short) that her wayward
 footsteps carried her not in a straight line but in a
 direction so constantly changing as to lead that acute
 observer, Professor Murray, to the conclusion that her
 path could only be described by the amount of attraction
 ascribable to Vi.

 Guided thus along their respective paths, the two
 magnitudes presently met with such suddenness that they
 almost intersected.

 &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the first magnitude very
 rigidly.

 &ldquo;You ought to indeed,&rdquo; said the second rather sulkily,
 &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve knocked Vi right out of my arms.&rdquo;

 She looked round despairingly for the little dog which
 seemed to have disappeared in the long grass.

 &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please pick him up?&rdquo; she pleaded.

 &ldquo;Not exactly in my line, you know,&rdquo; answered the other
 magnitude, &ldquo;but I tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, if you&rsquo;ll stand
 still, perfectly still where you are, and let me take
 hold of your hand, I&rsquo;ll describe a circle!&rdquo;

 &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you clever!&rdquo; cried the girl, clapping her
 hands. &ldquo;What a lovely idea! You describe a circle all
 around me, and then we&rsquo;ll look at every weeny bit of it
 and we&rsquo;ll be sure to find Vi&mdash;&rdquo;

 She reached out her hand to the other magnitude who
 clasped it with an assumed intensity sufficient to retain
 it.

 At this moment a third magnitude broke on the scene:&mdash;a
 huge oblong, angular figure, very difficult to describe,
 came revolving towards them.

 &ldquo;M,&rdquo; it shouted, &ldquo;Emily, what are you doing?&rdquo;

 &ldquo;My goodness,&rdquo; said the second magnitude in alarm, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
 MAMA.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I may say that the second instalment of Dr. Murray&rsquo;s fascinating
      romance will appear in the next number of the &ldquo;Illuminated Bookworm&rdquo;,
      the great adult-juvenile vehicle of the newer thought in which these
      theories of education are expounded further.

    <p>
      He came across to me in the semi-silence room of the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a rather queer hand at bridge last night,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you?&rdquo; I answered, and picked up a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It would have interested you, I think,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it?&rdquo; I said, and moved to another chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like this,&rdquo; he continued, following me: &ldquo;I held
      the king of hearts&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a minute,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I want to go and see what time
      it is.&rdquo; I went out and looked at the clock in the hall. I came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the queen and the ten&mdash;&rdquo; he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me just a second; I want to ring for a messenger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so. The waiter came and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the nine and two small ones,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two small what?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two small hearts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember
      which. Anyway, I remember very well indeed that I had the king and the
      queen and the jack, the nine, and two little ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a second,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I want to mail a letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came back to him, he was still murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My partner held the ace of clubs and the queen. The jack was out,
      but I didn&rsquo;t know where the king was&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; I said in contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated in surprise, and went on murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diamonds had gone round once, and spades twice, and so I suspected
      that my partner was leading from weakness&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;sheer weakness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the sixth round the lead came to
      me. Now, what should I have done? Finessed for the ace, or led straight
      into my opponent&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want my advice,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and you shall have it,
      openly and fairly. In such a case as you describe, where a man has led out
      at me repeatedly and with provocation, as I gather from what you say,
      though I myself do not play bridge, I should lead my whole hand at him. I
      repeat, I do not play bridge. But in the circumstances, I should think it
      the only thing to do.&rdquo;

      TRUTHFUL SPEECH GIVING THE REAL THOUGHTS OF A DISTINGUISHED GUEST AT THE
      FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY BANQUET OF A SOCIETY
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: If there is one thing I abominate more than
      another, it is turning out on a cold night like this to eat a huge dinner
      of twelve courses and know that I have to make a speech on top of it.
      Gentlemen, I just feel stuffed. That&rsquo;s the plain truth of it. By the
      time we had finished that fish, I could have gone home satisfied. Honestly
      I could. That&rsquo;s as much as I usually eat. And by the time I had
      finished the rest of the food, I felt simply waterlogged, and I do still.
      More than that. The knowledge that I had to make a speech congratulating
      this society of yours on its fiftieth anniversary haunted and racked me
      all through the meal. I am not, in plain truth, the ready and brilliant
      speaker you take me for. That is a pure myth. If you could see the
      desperate home scene that goes on in my family when I am working up a
      speech, your minds would be at rest on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll go further and be very frank with you. How this society has
      lived for fifty years, I don&rsquo;t know. If all your dinners are like
      this, Heaven help you. I&rsquo;ve only the vaguest idea of what this
      society is, anyway, and what it does. I tried to get a constitution this
      afternoon but failed. I am sure from some of the faces that I recognise
      around this table that there must be good business reasons of some sort
      for belonging to this society. There&rsquo;s money in it,&mdash;mark my
      words,&mdash;for some of you or you wouldn&rsquo;t be here. Of course I
      quite understand that the President and the officials seated here beside
      me come merely for the self-importance of it. That, gentlemen, is about
      their size. I realized that from their talk during the banquet. I don&rsquo;t
      want to speak bitterly, but the truth is they are SMALL men and it
      flatters them to sit here with two or three blue ribbons pinned on their
      coats. But as for me, I&rsquo;m done with it. It will be fifty years,
      please heaven, before this event comes round again. I hope, I earnestly
      hope, that I shall be safely under the ground.

    <p>
      THE SPEECH THAT OUGHT TO BE MADE BY A STATE GOVERNOR AFTER VISITING THE
      FALL EXPOSITION OF AN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, gentlemen, this Annual Fall Fair of the Skedink County Agricultural
      Association has come round again. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you straight
      out that of all the disagreeable jobs that fall to me as Governor of this
      State, my visit to your Fall Fair is about the toughest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to tell you, gentlemen, right here and now, that I don&rsquo;t know
      anything about agriculture and I don&rsquo;t want to. My parents were rich
      enough to bring me up in the city in a rational way. I didn&rsquo;t have
      to do chores in order to go to the high school as some of those present
      have boasted that they did. My only wonder is that they ever got there at
      all. They show no traces of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon, gentlemen, you took me all round your live-stock exhibit.
      I walked past, and through, nearly a quarter of a mile of hogs. What was
      it that they were called&mdash;Tamworths&mdash;Berkshires? I don&rsquo;t
      remember. But all I can say, gentlemen, is,&mdash;phew! Just that. Some of
      you will understand readily enough. That word sums up my whole idea of
      your agricultural show and I&rsquo;m done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, let me correct myself. There was just one feature of your agricultural
      exposition that met my warm approval. You were good enough to take me
      through the section of your exposition called your Midway Pleasance. Let
      me tell you, sirs, that there was more real merit in that than all the
      rest of the show put together. You apologized, if I remember rightly, for
      taking me into the large tent of the Syrian Dancing Girls. Oh, believe me,
      gentlemen, you needn&rsquo;t have. Syria is a country which commands my
      profoundest admiration. Some day I mean to spend a vacation there. And,
      believe me, gentlemen, when I do go,&mdash;and I say this with all the
      emphasis of which I am capable,&mdash;I should not wish to be accompanied
      by such a set of flatheads as the officials of your Agricultural Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, gentlemen, as I have just received a fake telegram, by
      arrangement, calling me back to the capital of the State, I must leave
      this banquet at once. One word in conclusion: if I had known as fully as I
      do now how it feels to drink half a bucket of sweet cider, I should
      certainly never have come.

    </h3>
    <p>
      TRUTHFUL SPEECH OF A DISTRICT POLITICIAN TO A LADIES&rsquo; SUFFRAGE
      SOCIETY
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladies: My own earnest, heartfelt conviction is that you are a pack of
      cats. I use the word &ldquo;cats&rdquo; advisedly, and I mean every letter
      of it. I want to go on record before this gathering as being strongly and
      unalterably opposed to Woman Suffrage until you get it. After that I
      favour it. My reasons for opposing the suffrage are of a kind that you
      couldn&rsquo;t understand. But all men,&mdash;except the few that I see at
      this meeting,&mdash;understand them by instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you may, however, succeed as a result of the fuss that you are making,&mdash;in
      getting votes, I have thought it best to come. Also,&mdash;I am free to
      confess,&mdash;I wanted to see what you looked like.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this last head I am disappointed. Personally I like women a good deal
      fatter than most of you are, and better looking. As I look around this
      gathering I see one or two of you that are not so bad, but on the whole
      not many. But my own strong personal predilection is and remains in favour
      of a woman who can cook, mend clothes, talk when I want her to, and give
      me the kind of admiration to which I am accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me, however, say in conclusion that I am altogether in sympathy with
      your movement to this extent. If you ever DO get votes,&mdash;and the
      indications are that you will (blast you),&mdash;I want your votes, and I
      want all of them.

    <p>
      We have lately been struck,&mdash;of course not dangerously,&mdash;by a
      new idea. A recent number of a well-known magazine contains an account of
      an American multimillionaire who, on account of the pressure of his brain
      power and the rush of his business, found it impossible to read the
      fiction of the day for himself. He therefore caused his secretaries to
      look through any new and likely novel and make a rapid report on its
      contents, indicating for his personal perusal the specially interesting
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Realizing the possibilities coiled up in this plan, we have opened a
      special agency or bureau for doing work of this sort. Any over-busy
      multimillionaire, or superman, who becomes our client may send us novels,
      essays, or books of any kind, and will receive a report explaining the
      plot and pointing out such parts as he may with propriety read. If he can
      once find time to send us a postcard, or a postal cablegram, night or day,
      we undertake to assume all the further effort of reading. Our terms for
      ordinary fiction are one dollar per chapter; for works of travel, 10 cents
      per mile; and for political or other essays, two cents per page, or ten
      dollars per idea, and for theological and controversial work, seven
      dollars and fifty cents per cubic yard extracted. Our clients are assured
      of prompt and immediate attention.

      Through the kindness of the Editor of the Century we are enabled to insert
      here a sample of our work. It was done to the order of a gentleman of
      means engaged in silver mining in Colorado, who wrote us that he was
      anxious to get &ldquo;a holt&rdquo; on modern fiction, but that he had no
      time actually to read it. On our assuring him that this was now
      unnecessary, he caused to be sent to us the monthly parts of a serial
      story, on which we duly reported as follows:

    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      We beg to inform you that the scene of the opening chapter of the Fortunes
      of Barbara Plynlimmon is laid in Wales. The scene is laid, however, very
      carelessly and hurriedly and we expect that it will shortly be removed. We
      cannot, therefore, recommend it to your perusal. As there is a very fine
      passage describing the Cambrian Hills by moonlight, we enclose herewith a
      condensed table showing the mean altitude of the moon for the month of
      December in the latitude of Wales. The character of Miss Plynlimmon we
      find to be developed in conversation with her grandmother, which we think
      you had better not read. Nor are we prepared to endorse your reading the
      speeches of the Welsh peasantry which we find in this chapter, but we
      forward herewith in place of them a short glossary of Welsh synonyms which
      may aid you in this connection.

      FEBRUARY INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      We regret to state that we find nothing in the second chapter of the
      Fortunes of Barbara Plynlimmon which need be reported to you at length. We
      think it well, however, to apprise you of the arrival of a young Oxford
      student in the neighbourhood of Miss Plynlimmon&rsquo;s cottage, who is
      apparently a young man of means and refinement. We enclose a list of the
      principal Oxford Colleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may state that from the conversation and manner of this young gentleman
      there is no ground for any apprehension on your part. But if need arises
      we will report by cable to you instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman in question meets Miss Plynlimmon at sunrise on the
      slopes of Snowdon. As the description of the meeting is very fine we send
      you a recent photograph of the sun.

    <h3>
      MARCH INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      Our surmise was right. The scene of the story that we are digesting for
      you is changed. Miss Plynlimmon has gone to London. You will be gratified
      to learn that she has fallen heir to a fortune of 100,000 pounds, which we
      are happy to compute for you at $486,666 and 66 cents less exchange. On
      Miss Plynlimmon&rsquo;s arrival at Charing Cross Station, she is
      overwhelmed with that strange feeling of isolation felt in the surging
      crowds of a modern city. We therefore enclose a timetable showing the
      arrival and departure of all trains at Charing Cross.

    <h3>
      APRIL INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      We beg to bring to your notice the fact that Miss Barbara Plynlimmon has
      by an arrangement made through her trustees become the inmate, on a
      pecuniary footing, in the household of a family of title. We are happy to
      inform you that her first appearance at dinner in evening dress was most
      gratifying: we can safely recommend you to read in this connection lines 4
      and 5 and the first half of line 6 on page 1OO of the book as enclosed. We
      regret to say that the Marquis of Slush and his eldest son Viscount
      Fitzbuse (courtesy title) are both addicted to drink. They have been
      drinking throughout the chapter. We are pleased to state that apparently
      the second son, Lord Radnor of Slush, who is away from home is not so
      addicted. We send you under separate cover a bottle of Radnor water.

    <h3>
      MAY INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      We regret to state that the affairs of Miss Barbara Plynlimmon are in a
      very unsatisfactory position. We enclose three pages of the novel with the
      urgent request that you will read them at once. The old Marquis of Slush
      has made approaches towards Miss Plynlimmon of such a scandalous nature
      that we think it best to ask you to read them in full. You will note also
      that young Viscount Slush who is tipsy through whole of pages 121-125,
      128-133, and part of page 140, has designs upon her fortune. We are sorry
      to see also that the Marchioness of Buse under the guise of friendship has
      insured Miss Plynlimmon&rsquo;s life and means to do away with her. The
      sister of the Marchioness, the Lady Dowager, also wishes to do away with
      her. The second housemaid who is tempted by her jewellery is also planning
      to do away with her. We feel that if this goes on she will be done away
      with.

    <h3>
      JUNE INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      We beg to advise you that Viscount Fitz-buse, inflamed by the beauty and
      innocence of Miss Plynlimmon, has gone so far as to lay his finger on her
      (read page 170, lines 6-7). She resisted his approaches. At the height of
      the struggle a young man, attired in the costume of a Welsh tourist, but
      wearing the stamp of an Oxford student, and yet carrying himself with the
      unmistakable hauteur (we knew it at once) of an aristocrat, burst, or
      bust, into the room. With one blow he felled Fitz-buse to the floor; with
      another he clasped the girl to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbara!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Radnor,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be pleased to learn that this is the second son of the Marquis,
      Viscount Radnor, just returned from a reading tour in Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S. We do not know what he read, so we enclose a file of Welsh
      newspapers to date.
    </p>
    <h3>
      JULY INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      We regret to inform you that the Marquis of Slush has disinherited his
      son. We grieve to state that Viscount Radnor has sworn that he will never
      ask for Miss Plynlimmon&rsquo;s hand till he has a fortune equal to her
      own. Meantime, we are sorry to say, he proposes to work.

      NOVEMBER INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      We are most happy to inform you that Miss Plynlimmon has saved the
      situation. Determined to be worthy of the generous love of Viscount
      Radnor, she has arranged to convey her entire fortune to the old family
      lawyer who acts as her trustee. She will thus become as poor as the
      Viscount and they can marry. The scene with the old lawyer who breaks into
      tears on receiving the fortune, swearing to hold and cherish it as his own
      is very touching. Meantime, as the Viscount is hunting for a job, we
      enclose a list of advertisements under the heading Help Wanted&mdash;Males.
    </p>
    <h3>
      DECEMBER INSTALMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      You will be very gratified to learn that the fortunes of Miss Barbara
      Plynlimmon have come to a most pleasing termination. Her marriage with the
      Viscount Radnor was celebrated very quietly on page 231. (We enclose a
      list of the principal churches in London.) No one was present except the
      old family lawyer, who was moved to tears at the sight of the bright,
      trusting bride, and the clergyman who wept at the sight of the cheque
      given him by the Viscount. After the ceremony the old trustee took Lord
      and Lady Radnor to a small wedding breakfast at an hotel (we enclose a
      list). During the breakfast a sudden faintness (for which we had been
      watching for ten pages) overcame him. He sank back in his chair, gasping.
      Lord and Lady Radnor rushed to him and sought in vain to tighten his
      necktie. He expired under their care, having just time to indicate in his
      pocket a will leaving them his entire wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had hardly happened when a messenger brought news to the Viscount
      that his brother, Lord Fitz-buse had been killed in the hunting field, and
      that he (meaning him, himself) had now succeeded to the title. Lord and
      Lady Fitz-buse had hardly time to reach the town house of the family when
      they learned that owing to the sudden death of the old Marquis (also, we
      believe, in the hunting field), they had become the Marquis and the
      Marchioness of Slush.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis and the Marchioness of Slush are still living in their
      ancestral home in London. Their lives are an example to all their tenantry
      in Piccadilly, the Strand and elsewhere.

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;SPEEDING UP BUSINESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were sitting at our editorial desk in our inner room, quietly writing
      up our week&rsquo;s poetry, when a stranger looked in upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in with a burst,&mdash;like the entry of the hero of western drama
      coming in out of a snowstorm. His manner was all excitement. &ldquo;Sit
      down,&rdquo; we said, in our grave, courteous way. &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed, &ldquo;certainly not! Are you aware of the amount of time
      and energy that are being wasted in American business by the practice of
      perpetually sitting down and standing up again? Do you realize that every
      time you sit down and stand up you make a dead lift of&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked at us,&mdash;&ldquo;two hundred and fifty pounds? Did you ever
      reflect that every time you sit down you have to get up again?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; we said quietly, &ldquo;we never thought of it.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;d rather
      go on lifting 250 pounds through two feet,&mdash;an average of 500
      foot-pounds, practically 62 kilowatts of wasted power. Do you know that by
      merely hitching a pulley to the back of your neck you could generate
      enough power to light your whole office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We hung our heads. Simple as the thing was, we had never thought of it.
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the Stranger. &ldquo;Now, all American
      business men are like you. They don&rsquo;t think,&mdash;do you understand
      me? They don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We realized the truth of it at once. We had never thought. Perhaps we didn&rsquo;t
      even know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I tell you,&rdquo; continued our visitor, speaking rapidly and
      with a light of wild enthusiasm in his face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out for a
      new campaign,&mdash;efficiency in business&mdash;speeding things up&mdash;better
      organization.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; we said, musingly, &ldquo;we have seen something
      about this lately in the papers?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seen it, sir,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;I should say so. It&rsquo;s everywhere. It&rsquo;s a new
      movement. It&rsquo;s in the air. Has it never struck you how a thing like
      this can be seen in the air?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again we were at fault. In all our lives we had never seen anything
      in the air. We had never even looked there. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued
      the Stranger, &ldquo;I want your paper to help. I want you to join in. I
      want you to give publicity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; we said, with our old-fashioned politeness.
      &ldquo;Anything which concerns the welfare, the progress, if one may so
      phrase it&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the visitor. &ldquo;You
      talk too much. You&rsquo;re prosy. Don&rsquo;t talk. Listen to me. Try and
      fix your mind on what I am about to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We fixed it. The Stranger&rsquo;s manner became somewhat calmer. &ldquo;I
      am heading,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the new American efficiency movement. I
      have sent our circulars to fifty thousand representative firms, explaining
      my methods. I am receiving ten thousand answers a day&rdquo;&mdash;here he
      dragged a bundle of letters out of his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;from Maine,
      from New Hampshire, from Vermont,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Massachusetts, Rhode
      Island, Connecticut,&rdquo; we murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;from every State in the Union&mdash;from
      the Philippines, from Porto Rico, and last week I had one from Canada.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Marvellous,&rdquo; we said; &ldquo;and may one ask what your new
      methods are?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proper question.
      It&rsquo;s a typical business question, fair, plain, clean, and even
      admitting of an answer. The great art of answering questions,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;is to answer at once without loss of time, friction or
      delay in moving from place to place. I&rsquo;ll answer it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the Stranger. &ldquo;My method is first: to
      stimulate business to the highest point by infusing into it everywhere the
      spirit of generous rivalry, of wholesome competition; by inviting each and
      every worker to outdo each and every other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can they do it?&rdquo; we asked, puzzled and yet fascinated.
      &ldquo;Can they all do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, and they can,&rdquo; said the Stranger. &ldquo;The proof
      of it is that they are doing it. Listen. Here is an answer to my circular
      No. 6, Efficiency and Recompense, that came in this morning. It is from a
      steel firm. Listen.&rdquo; The Stranger picked out a letter and read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      Our firm is a Steel Corporation. We roll rails. As soon as we read your
      circular on the Stimulus of Competition we saw that there were big things
      in it. At once we sent one of our chief managers to the rolling, mill. He
      carried a paper bag in his hand. &ldquo;Now boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every
      man who rolls a rail gets a gum-drop.&rdquo; The effect was magical. The
      good fellows felt a new stimulus. They now roll out rails like dough. Work
      is a joy to them. Every Saturday night the man who has rolled most gets a
      blue ribbon; the man who has rolled the next most, a green ribbon; the
      next most a yellow ribbon, and so on through the spectroscope. The man who
      rolls least gets only a red ribbon. It is a real pleasure to see the brave
      fellows clamouring for their ribbons. Our output, after defraying the
      entire cost of the ribbons and the gum-drops, has increased forty per
      cent. We intend to carry the scheme further by allowing all the men who
      get a hundred blue ribbons first, to exchange them for the Grand
      Efficiency Prize of the firm,&mdash;a pink ribbon. This the winner will be
      entitled to wear whenever and wherever he sees fit to wear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger paused for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marvellous,&rdquo; we said. &ldquo;There is no doubt the stimulus
      of keen competition&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;Let me explain it
      further. Competition is only part of it. An item just as big that makes
      for efficiency is to take account of the little things. It&rsquo;s the
      little things that are never thought of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was another wonder! We realized that we had never thought of them.
      &ldquo;Take an example,&rdquo; the Stranger continued. &ldquo;I went into
      a hotel the other day. What did I see? Bell-boys being summoned upstairs
      every minute, and flying up in the elevators. Yes,&mdash;and every time
      they went up they had to come down again. I went up to the manager. I
      said, &lsquo;I can understand that when your guests ring for the bell-boys
      they have to go up. But why should they come down? Why not have them go up
      and never come down?&rsquo; He caught the idea at once. That hotel is
      transformed. I have a letter from the manager stating that they find it
      fifty per cent. cheaper to hire new bell-boys instead of waiting for the
      old ones to come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These results,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;are certainly marvellous.
      &ldquo;You are most assuredly to be congratulated on&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk too much,&rdquo; said the Stranger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do
      it. Learn to listen. If a young man comes to me for advice in business,&mdash;and
      they do in hundreds, lots of them,&mdash;almost in tears over their
      inefficiency,&mdash;I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Young man, never talk, listen;
      answer, but don&rsquo;t speak.&rsquo; But even all this is only part of
      the method. Another side of it is technique.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Technique?&rdquo; we said, pleased but puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the proper use of machine devices. Take the building trade. I&rsquo;ve
      revolutionized it. Till now all the bricks even for a high building were
      carried up to the mason in hods. Madness! Think of the waste of it. By my
      method instead of carrying the bricks to the mason we take the mason to
      the brick,&mdash;lower him on a wire rope, give him a brick, and up he
      goes again. As soon as he wants another brick he calls down, &lsquo;I want
      a brick,&rsquo; and down he comes like lightning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;is little short of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it out. Even that is not all. Another thing bigger than any is
      organization. Half the business in this country is not organized. As soon
      as I sent out my circular, No. 4, HAVE YOU ORGANIZED YOUR BUSINESS! I got
      answers in thousands! Heart-broken, many of them. They had never thought
      of it! Here, for example, is a letter written by a plain man, a gardener,
      just an ordinary man, a plain man&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;quite so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here is what he writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I got your circular I read it all through from end to end, and
      I saw that all my failure in the past had come from my not being
      organized. I sat and thought a long while and I decided that I would
      organize myself. I went right in to the house and I said to my wife,
      &ldquo;Jane, I&rsquo;m going to organize myself.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Oh,
      John!&rdquo;&mdash;and not another word, but you should have seen the look
      on her face. So the next morning I got up early and began to organize
      myself. It was hard at first but I stuck to it. There were times when I
      felt as if I couldn&rsquo;t do it. It seemed too hard. But bit by bit I
      did it and now, thank God, I am organized. I wish all men like me could
      know the pleasure I feel in being organized.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touching, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the Stranger. &ldquo;But I
      get lots of letters like that. Here&rsquo;s another, also from a man, a
      plain man, working on his own farm. Hear what he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I saw your circular on HOW TO SPEED UP THE EMPLOYEE I felt that
      it was a big thing. I don&rsquo;t have any hired help here to work with
      me, but only father. He cuts the wood and does odd chores about the place.
      So I realized that the best I could do was to try to speed up father. I
      started in to speed him up last Tuesday, and I wish you could see him.
      Before this he couldn&rsquo;t split a cord of wood without cutting a slice
      off his boots. Now he does it in half the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there,&rdquo; the Stranger said, getting impatient even with
      his own reading, &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t read it all. It is the same thing
      all along the line. I&rsquo;ve got the Method introduced into the
      Department Stores. Before this every customer who came in wasted time
      trying to find the counters. Now we install a patent springboard, with a
      mechanism like a catapault. As soon as a customer comes in an attendant
      puts him on the board, blindfolds him, and says, &lsquo;Where do you want
      to go?&rsquo; &lsquo;Glove counter.&rsquo; Oh, all right.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s
      fired at it through the air. No time lost. Same with the railways. They&rsquo;re
      installing the Method, too. Every engineer who breaks the record from New
      York to Buffalo gets a glass of milk. When he gets a hundred glasses he
      can exchange them for a glass of beer. So with the doctors. On the new
      method, instead of giving a patient one pill a day for fourteen days they
      give him fourteen pills in one day. Doctors, lawyers, everybody,&mdash;in
      time, sir,&rdquo; said the Stranger, in tones of rising excitement,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see even the plumbers&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But just at this moment the door opened. A sturdy-looking man in blue
      entered. The Stranger&rsquo;s voice was hushed at once. The excitement
      died out of his face. His manner all of a sudden was meekness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just coming,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;better come
      along and not take up the gentleman&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; said the Stranger, with meek affability, and
      he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in blue lingered behind for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sad case, sir,&rdquo; he said, and he tapped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Cracked, sir. Quite cracked; but harmless. I&rsquo;m
      engaged to look after him, but he gave me the slip downstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is under delusions?&rdquo; we inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. He&rsquo;s got it into his head that business in this
      country has all gone to pieces,&mdash;thinks it must be reorganized. He
      writes letters about it all day and sends them to the papers with
      imaginary names. You may have seen some of them. Good day, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked at our watch. We had lost just half an hour over the new
      efficiency. We turned back with a sigh to our old-fashioned task.

      twentieth century press.)

    <p>
      His voice as he turned towards her was taut as a tie-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love me!&rdquo; he hoarsed, thick with agony. She
      had angled into a seat and sat sensing-rather-than-seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time she silenced. Then presently as he still stood and enveloped
      her,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she thinned, her voice fining to a thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; he gloomed, still gazing into-and-through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half-heard half-didn&rsquo;t-hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was falling about them as they sat thus beside the river. A molten
      afterglow of iridescent saffron shot with incandescent carmine lit up the
      waters of the Hudson till they glowed like electrified uranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while they both sat silent,&mdash;looming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to be,&rdquo; she glumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Why should it have had to have
      been or (more hopefully) even be to be? Surely you don&rsquo;t mean
      because of MONEY?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered into herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing seemed to sting her (it hadn&rsquo;t really).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; she almost-but-not-quite-moaned. &ldquo;You might

      He sank down and grassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after they had sat thus for another half-hour grassing and growling
      and angling and sensing one another, it turned out that all that he was
      trying to say was to ask if she would marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course she said yes.

      XIII.&mdash;WEEJEE THE PET DOG
    </h2>
    <h3>
      An Idyll of the Summer
    </h3>
    <p>
      We were sitting on the verandah of the Sopley&rsquo;s summer cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely it is here,&rdquo; I said to my host and hostess,
      &ldquo;and how still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Weejee, the pet dog, took a sharp nip at the
      end of my tennis trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weejee!!&rdquo; exclaimed his mistress with great emphasis, &ldquo;BAD
      dog! how dare you, sir! BAD dog!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he hasn&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; said my host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; I answered cheerfully. &ldquo;He
      hardly scratched me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t think he means anything by it,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Sopley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m SURE he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weejee was coming nearer to me again as I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WEEJEE!!&rdquo; cried my hostess, &ldquo;naughty dog, bad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny thing about that dog,&rdquo; said Sopley, &ldquo;the way he
      KNOWS people. It&rsquo;s a sort of instinct. He knew right away that you
      were a stranger,&mdash;now, yesterday, when the butcher came, there was a
      new driver on the cart and Weejee knew it right away,&mdash;grabbed the
      man by the leg at once,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t let go. I called out to the
      man that it was all right or he might have done Weejee some harm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Weejee took the second nip at my other trouser leg. There
      was a short GUR-R-R and a slight mix-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weejee! Weejee!&rdquo; called Mrs. Sopley. &ldquo;How DARE you,
      sir! You&rsquo;re just a BAD dog!! Go and lie down, sir. I&rsquo;m so
      sorry. I think, you know, it&rsquo;s your white trousers. For some reason
      Weejee simply HATES white trousers. I do hope he hasn&rsquo;t torn them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing only a slight
      tear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Weege, Weege,&rdquo; said Sopley, anxious to make a diversion
      and picking up a little chip of wood,&mdash;&ldquo;chase it, fetch it out!&rdquo;
      and he made the motions of throwing it into the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw it too far, Charles,&rdquo; said his wife.
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t swim awfully well,&rdquo; she continued, turning
      to me, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m always afraid he might get out of his depth.
      Last week he was ever so nearly drowned. Mr. Van Toy was in swimming, and
      he had on a dark blue suit (dark blue seems simply to infuriate Weejee)
      and Weejee just dashed in after him. He don&rsquo;t MEAN anything, you
      know, it was only the SUIT made him angry,&mdash;he really likes Mr. Van
      Toy,&mdash;but just for a minute we were quite alarmed. If Mr. Van Toy
      hadn&rsquo;t carried Weejee in I think he might have been drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jove!&rdquo; I said in a tone to indicate how appalled I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me throw the stick, Charles,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Sopley.
      &ldquo;Now, Weejee, look Weejee&mdash;here, good dog&mdash;look! look now
      (sometimes Weejee simply won&rsquo;t do what one wants), here, Weejee;
      now, good dog!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Weejee had his tail sideways between his legs and was moving towards me
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Sopley in a stern tone, &ldquo;let me throw
      him in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be careful, Charles,&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sopley picked Weejee up by the collar and carried him to the edge of the
      water&mdash;it was about six inches deep,&mdash;and threw him in,&mdash;with
      much the same force as, let us say, a pen is thrown into ink or a brush
      dipped into a pot of varnish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough; that&rsquo;s quite enough, Charles,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Mrs. Sopley. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;d better not swim. The
      water in the evening is always a little cold. Good dog, good doggie, good
      Weejee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime &ldquo;good Weejee&rdquo; had come out of the water and was
      moving again towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He goes straight to you,&rdquo; said my hostess. &ldquo;I think he
      must have taken a fancy to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove it, Weejee gave himself a rotary whirl like a twirled mop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m SO sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sopley. &ldquo;I am. He&rsquo;s
      wetted you. Weejee, lie down, down, sir, good dog, bad dog, lie down!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve another
      white suit in my valise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be wet through,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sopley. &ldquo;Perhaps
      we&rsquo;d better go in. It&rsquo;s getting late, anyway, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      And then she added to her husband, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Weejee ought
      to sit out here now that he&rsquo;s wet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find everything you need,&rdquo; said Sopley,
      as he showed me to my room, &ldquo;and, by the way, don&rsquo;t mind if
      Weejee comes into your room at night. We like to let him run all over the
      house and he often sleeps on this bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Weejee came.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when it was far on in the dead of night&mdash;so that even the lake
      and the trees were hushed in sleep, I took Weejee out and&mdash;but there
      is no need to give the details of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Sopleys are still wondering where Weejee has gone to, and waiting
      for him to come back, because he is so clever at finding his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from where Weejee is, no one finds his way back.

    <h2>
      XIV.&mdash;SIDELIGHTS ON THE SUPERMEN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      An Interview with General Bernhardi
    </h3>
    <p>
      He came into my room in that modest, Prussian way that he has, clicking
      his heels together, his head very erect, his neck tightly gripped in his
      forty-two centimeter collar. He had on a Pickelhaube, or Prussian helmet,
      which he removed with a sweeping gesture and laid on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I knew at once that it was General Bernhardi.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his age he looked&mdash;I am bound to admit it&mdash;a fine
      figure of a man. There was a splendid fullness about his chest and
      shoulders, and a suggestion of rugged power all over him. I had not heard
      him on the stairs. He seemed to appear suddenly beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get past the janitor?&rdquo; I asked. For it was late
      at night, and my room at college is three flights up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The janitor,&rdquo; he answered carelessly, &ldquo;I killed him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His resistance,&rdquo; the general went on, &ldquo;was very slight.
      Apparently in this country your janitors are unarmed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You killed him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We Prussians,&rdquo; said Bernhardi, &ldquo;when we wish an
      immediate access anywhere, always kill the janitor. It is quicker: and it
      makes for efficiency. It impresses them with a sense of our Furchtbarkeit.
      You have no word for that in English, I believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not outside of a livery stable,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. I was thinking of the janitor. It seemed in a sort of
      way&mdash;I admit that I have a sentimental streak in me&mdash;a
      deplorable thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; I said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered the General, but remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he repeated, without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Perhaps you CAN&rsquo;T sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;in fact, we Prussian
      officers&rdquo;&mdash;here he drew himself up higher still&mdash;&ldquo;never
      sit down. Our uniforms do not permit of it. This inspires us with a kind
      of Rastlosigkeit.&rdquo; Here his eyes glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, with an Unsittlichkeit&mdash;an Unverschamtheit&mdash;with
      an Ein-fur-alle-mal-un-dur-chaus&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I said, for I saw that he was getting excited,
      &ldquo;but pray tell me, General, to what do I owe the honour of this
      visit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The General&rsquo;s manner changed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highly learned, and high-well-born-professor,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I come to you as to a fellow author, known and honoured not merely
      in England, for that is nothing, but in Germany herself, and in Turkey,
      the very home of Culture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that it was mere flattery. I knew that in this same way Lord
      Haldane had been so captivated as to come out of the Emperor&rsquo;s
      presence unable to say anything but &ldquo;Sittlichkeit&rdquo; for weeks;
      that good old John Burns had been betrayed by a single dinner at Potsdam,
      and that the Sultan of Turkey had been told that his Answers to Ultimatums
      were the wittiest things written since Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Pure
      Reason. Yet I was pleased in spite of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;they know my works of humour in
      Germany?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they know them?&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;Ach! Himmel! How
      they laugh. That work of yours (I think I see it on the shelf behind you),
      The Elements of Political Science, how the Kaiser has laughed over it! And
      the Crown Prince! It nearly killed him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send him the new edition,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But tell me,
      General, what is it that you want of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about my own book,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You have read
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed to a copy of Germany and the Next War, in its glaring yellow
      cover&mdash;the very hue of Furchtbarkeit&mdash;lying on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read it? You have really read it?&rdquo; asked the General
      with great animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say that.
      But I have TRIED to read it. And I talk about it as if I had read it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The General&rsquo;s face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as the others,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;They buy the book,
      they lay it on the table, they talk of it at dinner,&mdash;they say
      &lsquo;Bernhardi has prophesied this, Bernhardi foresaw that,&rsquo; but
      read it,&mdash;nevermore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you get the royalties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are cut off. The perfidious British Government will not allow
      the treacherous publisher to pay them. But that is not my complaint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My book is misunderstood. You English readers have failed to grasp
      its intention. It is not meant as a book of strategy. It is what you call
      a work of humour. The book is to laugh. It is one big joke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; I said in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; answered the General. &ldquo;Here&rdquo;&mdash;and
      with this he laid hold of the copy of the book before me and began rapidly
      turning over the leaves&mdash;&ldquo;let me set it out asunder for you,
      the humour of it. Listen, though, to this, where I speak of Germany&rsquo;s
      historical mission on page 73,&mdash;&lsquo;No nation on the face of the
      globe is so able to grasp and appropriate all the elements of culture as
      Germany is?&rsquo; What do you say to that? Is it not a joke? Ach, Himmel,
      how our officers have laughed over that in Belgium! With their booted feet
      on the mantelpiece as they read and with bottles of appropriated champagne
      beside them as they laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, General,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you will forgive my
      not laughing out loud, but you are a great humorist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not? And listen further still, how I deal with the theme of
      the German character,&mdash;&lsquo;Moral obligations such as no nation had
      ever yet made the standard of conduct, are laid down by the German
      philosophers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;gloriously funny; read me some more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, you will like,&mdash;here I deal with the permissible
      rules of war. It is on page 236 that I am reading it. I wrote this chiefly
      to make laugh our naval men and our Zeppelin crews,&mdash;&lsquo;A
      surprise attack, in order to be justified, must be made only on the armed
      forces of the state and not on its peaceful inhabitants. Otherwise the
      attack becomes a treacherous crime.&rsquo; Eh, what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the General broke into roars of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Your book ought to sell well in
      Scarborough and in Yarmouth. Read some more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to read you what I say about neutrality, and how
      England is certain to violate our strategical right by an attack on
      Belgium and about the sharp measures that ought to be taken against
      neutral ships laden with contraband,&mdash;the passages are in Chapters
      VII and VIII, but for the moment I fail to lay the thumb on them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the book, General,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now that I
      understand what you meant by it, I think I can show you also some very
      funny passages in it. These things, for example, that you say about Canada
      and the colonies,&mdash;yes, here it is, page 148,&mdash;&lsquo;In the
      event of war the loosely-joined British Empire will break into pieces, and
      the colonies will consult their own interests,&rsquo;&mdash;excellently
      funny,&mdash;and this again,&mdash;&lsquo;Canada will not permanently
      retain any trace of the English spirit,&rsquo;&mdash;and this too,&mdash;&lsquo;the
      Colonies can be completely ignored so far as the European theatre of war
      is concerned,&rsquo;&mdash;and here again,&mdash;&lsquo;Egypt and South
      Africa will at once revolt and break away from the empire,&rsquo; &mdash;really,
      General, your ideas of the British Colonies are superbly funny. Mark Twain
      wasn&rsquo;t a circumstance on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Bernhardi, and his voice reverted to his
      habitual Prussian severity, &ldquo;these are not jokes. They are facts. It
      is only through the folly of the Canadians in not reading my book that
      they are not more widely known. Even as it is they are exactly the views
      of your great leader Heinrich Bauratze&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heinrich Bauratze, your great Canadian leader&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leader of what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do not know,&rdquo; said Bernhardi. &ldquo;Our intelligence
      office has not yet heard what he leads. But as soon as he leads anything
      we shall know it. Meantime we can see from his speeches that he has read
      my book. Ach! if only your other leaders in Canada,&mdash;Sir Robert
      Laurier, Sir Osler Sifton, Sir Williams Borden,&mdash;you smile, you do
      not realize that in Germany we have exact information of everything: all
      that happens, we know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime I had been looking over the leaves of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here at least,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is some splendidly humorous
      stuff,&mdash;this about the navy. &lsquo;The completion of the Kiel Canal,&rsquo;
      you write in Chapter XII, &lsquo;is of great importance as it will enable
      our largest battleships to appear unexpectedly in the Baltic and in the
      North Sea!&rsquo; Appear unexpectedly! If they only would! How exquisitely
      absurd&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;That is not to laugh. You err
      yourself. That is Furchtbarkeit. I did not say the book is all humour.
      That would be false art. Part of it is humour and part is Furchbarkeit.
      That passage is specially designed to frighten Admiral Jellicoe. And he
      won&rsquo;t read it! Potztausand, he won&rsquo;t read it!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated
      the general, his eyes flashing and his clenched fist striking in the air&mdash;&ldquo;What
      sort of combatants are these of the British Navy who refuse to read our
      war-books? The Kaiser&rsquo;s Heligoland speech! They never read a word of
      it. The Furchtbarkeit-Proklamation of August,&mdash;they never looked at
      it. The Reichstags-Rede with the printed picture of the Kaiser shaking
      hands with everybody,&mdash;they used it to wrap up sandwiches! What are
      they, then, Jellicoe and his men? They sit there in their ships and they
      read nothing! How can we get at them if they refuse to read? How can we
      frighten them away if they haven&rsquo;t culture enough to get frightened.
      Beim Himmel,&rdquo; shouted the General in great excitement&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But what more he said can never be known. For at this second a sudden
      catastrophe happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his frenzy of excitement the General struck with his fist at the table,
      missed it, lost his balance and fell over sideways right on the point of
      his Pickelhaube which he had laid on the sofa. There was a sudden sound as
      of the ripping of cloth and the bursting of pneumatic cushions and to my
      amazement the General collapsed on the sofa, his uniform suddenly
      punctured in a dozen places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schnapps,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;fetch brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens! General,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what has happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uniform!&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;it has burst! Give me
      Schnapps!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to shrink visibly in size. His magnificent chest was gone. He
      was shrivelling into a tattered heap. He appeared as he lay there, a very
      allegory and illustration of Prussian Furchtbarkeit with the wind going
      out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch Schnapps,&rdquo;&mdash;he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no Schnapps here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is McGill
      University.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then call the janitor,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You killed him,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I was lying. I gave him a look that should have
      killed him, but I don&rsquo;t think it did. Rouse yourself from your
      chair, and call him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; I said, and started up from my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as I did so, the form of General Bernhardi, which I could have sworn
      had been lying in a tattered heap on the sofa on the other side of the
      room, seemed suddenly to vanish from my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing before me but the empty room with the fire burned low in
      the grate, and in front of me an open copy of Bernhardi&rsquo;s book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must,&mdash;like many another reader,&mdash;have fallen asleep over it.

      XV.&mdash;THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      A bell tinkled over the door of the little drug store as I entered it;
      which seemed strange in a lighted street of a great city.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the little store itself, dim even in the centre and dark in the
      corners was gloomy enough for a country crossroads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to have the bell,&rdquo; said the man behind the counter,
      reading my thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone here just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A toothbrush?&rdquo; he said in answer to my question. &ldquo;Yes,
      I guess I&rsquo;ve got some somewhere round here.&rdquo; He was stooping
      under and behind his counter and his voice came up from below. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got some somewhere&mdash;&rdquo; And then as if talking to himself he
      murmured from behind a pile of cardboard boxes, &ldquo;I saw some Tuesday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I gone across the street to the brilliant premises of the Cut Rate
      Pharmaceutical where they burn electric light by the meterfull I should no
      sooner have said &ldquo;tooth brush,&rdquo; than one of the ten clerks in
      white hospital jackets would have poured a glittering assortment over the
      counter&mdash;prophylactic, lactic and every other sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had turned in, I don&rsquo;t know why, to the little store across
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I guess these must be tooth brushes,&rdquo; he said,
      reappearing at the level of the counter with a flat box in his hand. They
      must have been presumably, or have once been,&mdash;at some time long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re tooth brushes all right,&rdquo; he said, and started
      looking over them with an owner&rsquo;s interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the price of them?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the man said musingly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;jest&mdash;know.
      I guess it&rsquo;s written on them likely,&rdquo; and he began to look at
      the handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over at the Pharmaceutical across the way the words &ldquo;what price?&rdquo;
      would have precipitated a ready avalanche of figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one seems to be seventy-five cents,&rdquo; he said and handed
      me one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a good tooth brush?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d think, at that
      price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no shop talk, no patter whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked at the brush again, more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it IS seventy-five,&rdquo; he muttered,
      &ldquo;I think it must be fifteen, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it from his hand and looked and said,&mdash;for it is well to take
      an occasional step towards the Kingdom of Heaven,&mdash;that I was certain
      it was seventy-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;perhaps it is, my sight is not so
      good now. I&rsquo;ve had too much to do here and the work&rsquo;s been
      using me up some.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed now as he said this how frail he looked as he bent over his
      counter wrapping up the tooth brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no sealing wax,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or not handy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;just put it in
      the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the way of course the tooth brush would have been done up almost
      instantaneously, in white enamel paper, sealed at the end and stamped with
      a label, as fast as the money paid for it went rattling along an automatic
      carrier to a cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very busy, eh?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not so much with customers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but with
      fixing up the place,&rdquo;&mdash;here he glanced about him. Heaven only
      knows what he had fixed. There were no visible signs of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I&rsquo;ve only been in here a couple of months. It was a
      pretty tough looking place when I came to it. But I&rsquo;ve been getting
      things fixed. First thing I did I put those two carboys in the window with
      the lights behind them. They show up fine, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; I repeated; so fine indeed that the dim yellow light
      in them reached three or four feet from the jar. But for the streaming
      light from the great store across the street, the windows of the little
      shop would have been invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good location here,&rdquo; he said. Any one could have
      told him that it was the worst location within two miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it going presently,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Of
      course it&rsquo;s uphill just at first. Being such a good location the
      rent is high. The first two weeks I was here I was losing five dollars a
      day. But I got those lights in the window and got the stock overhauled a
      little to make it attractive and last month I reckon I was only losing
      three dollars a day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he went on, and there was a clear glint of purpose
      in his eye that contrasted with his sunken cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
      it going. This last two weeks I&rsquo;m not losing more than say two and a
      half a day or something like that? The custom is bound to come. You get a
      place fixed up and made attractive like this and people are sure to come
      sooner or later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What it was that was fixed up, and wherein lay the attractiveness I do not
      know. It could not be seen with the outward eye. Perhaps after two months&rsquo;
      work of piling dusty boxes now this way, now that, and putting little
      candles behind the yellow carboys to try the effect, some inward vision
      came that lighted the place up with an attractiveness wanting even in the
      glass and marble glitter of the Pharmacy across the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; continued the man, &ldquo;I mean to stay with it.
      I&rsquo;ll get things into shape here, fix it up a little more and soon I&rsquo;ll
      have it,&rdquo;&mdash;here his face radiated with a vision of hope&mdash;&ldquo;so
      that I won&rsquo;t lose a single cent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him in surprise. So humble an ambition it had never been my
      lot to encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that bothers me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is my health. It&rsquo;s
      a nice business the drug business: I like it, but it takes it out of you.
      You&rsquo;ve got to be alert and keen all the time; thinking out plans to
      please the custom when it comes. Often I don&rsquo;t sleep well nights for
      the rush of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked about the little shop, as gloomy and sleepful as the mausoleum of
      an eastern king, and wondered by what alchemy of the mind the little
      druggist found it a very vortex of activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can fix my health,&rdquo; he returned&mdash;&ldquo;I may have
      to get some one in here and go away for a spell. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll do it.
      The doctor was saying he thought I might take a spell off and think out a
      few more wrinkles while I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; I looked at him more warmly, and I saw
      then what was plain enough to see but for the dim light of the little
      place,&mdash;the thin flush on the cheek, the hopeful mind, the contrast
      of the will to live and the need to die, God&rsquo;s little irony on man,
      it was all there plain enough to read. The &ldquo;spell&rdquo; for which
      the little druggist was going is that which is written in letters of
      sorrow over the sunlit desolation of Arizona and the mountains of
      Colorado.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month went by before I passed that way again. I looked across at the
      little store and I read the story in its drawn blinds and the padlock on
      its door.

      The little druggist had gone away for a spell. And they told me, on
      enquiry, that his journey had been no further than to the cemetery behind
      the town where he lies now, musing, if he still can, on the law of the
      survival of the fittest in this well-adjusted world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they say that the shock of the addition of his whole business to the
      great Pharmacy across the way scarcely disturbed a soda siphon.

    <h2>
      XVI&mdash;THE FIRST NEWSPAPER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A Sort of Allegory
    </h3>
    <p>
      How likes it you, Master Brenton?&rdquo; said the brawny journeyman,
      spreading out the news sheet on a smooth oaken table where it lay under
      the light of a leaded window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A marvellous fair sheet,&rdquo; murmured Brenton Caxton, seventh of
      the name, &ldquo;let me but adjust my glasses and peruse it further lest
      haply there be still aught in it that smacks of error.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needs not,&rdquo; said the journeyman, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the
      fourth time already from the press.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; answered Master Brenton softly, as he adjusted his
      great horn-rimmed spectacles and bent his head over the broad damp news
      sheet before him. &ldquo;Let us grudge no care in this. The venture is a
      new one and, meseems, a very parlous thing withal. &lsquo;Tis a venture
      that may easily fail and carry down our fortunes with it, but at least let
      it not be said that it failed for want of brains in the doing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fail quotha!&rdquo; said a third man, who had not yet spoken, old,
      tall and sour of visage and wearing a printer&rsquo;s leather apron. He
      had moved over from the further side of the room where a little group of
      apprentices stood beside the wooden presses that occupied the corner, and
      he was looking over the shoulder of Master Brenton Caxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it do aught else? &lsquo;Tis a mad folly. Mark you, Master
      Brenton and Master Nick, I have said it from the first and let the blame
      be none of mine. &lsquo;Tis a mad thing you do here. See then,&rdquo; he
      went on, turning and waving his hand, &ldquo;this vast room, these great
      presses, yonder benches and tools, all new, yonder vats of ink straight
      out of Flanders, how think you you can recover the cost of all this out of
      yonder poor sheets? Five and forty years have I followed this mystery of
      printing, ever since thy grandfather&rsquo;s day, Master Brenton, and
      never have I seen the like. What needed this great chamber when your
      grandfather and father were content with but a garret place, and yonder
      presses that can turn off four score copies in the compass of a single
      hour,&mdash;&lsquo;Tis mad folly, I say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment was an interesting one. The speakers were in a great room with
      a tall ceiling traversed by blackened beams. From the street below there
      came dimly through the closed casements the sound of rumbling traffic and
      the street cries of the London of the seventeenth century. Two vast
      presses of such colossal size that their wooden levers would tax the
      strength of the stoutest apprentice, were ranged against the further wall.
      About the room, spread out on oaken chairs and wooden benches, were flat
      boxes filled with leaden type, freshly molten, and a great pile of paper,
      larger than a man could lift, stood in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first English newspaper in history was going to press. Those who in
      later ages,&mdash;editors, printers, and workers&mdash;have participated
      in the same scene, can form some idea of the hopes and fears, the doubts
      and the difficulties, with which the first newspaper was ushered into the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Brenton Caxton turned upon the last speaker the undisturbed look of
      the eye that sees far across the present into the years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Edward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have laboured over much in
      the past and see not into the future. You think this chamber too great for
      our purpose? I tell you the time will come when not this room alone but
      three or four such will be needed for our task. Already I have it in my
      mind that I will divide even this room into portions, with walls shrewdly
      placed through its length and breadth, so that each that worketh shall sit
      as it were in his own chamber and there shall stand one at the door and
      whosoever cometh, to whatever part of our task his business appertains, he
      shall forthwith be brought to the room of him that hath charge of it.
      Cometh he with a madrigal or other light poesy that he would set out on
      the press, he shall find one that has charge of such matters and can
      discern their true value. Or, cometh he with news of aught that happens in
      the realm, so shall he be brought instant to the room of him that
      recordeth such events. Or, if so be, he would write a discourse on what
      seemeth him some wise conceit touching the public concerns, he shall find
      to his hand a convenient desk with ink and quills and all that he needeth
      to set it straightway on paper; thus shall there be a great abundance of
      written matter to our hand so that not many days shall elapse after one of
      our news sheets goes abroad before there be matter enough to fill another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Days!&rdquo; said the aged printer, &ldquo;think you you can fill
      one of these news sheets in a few days! Where indeed if you search the
      whole realm will you find talk enough in a single week to fill out this
      great sheet half an ell wide!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, days indeed!&rdquo; broke in Master Nicholas, the younger
      journeyman. &ldquo;Master Brenton speaks truth, or less than truth. For
      not days indeed, but in the compass of a single day, I warrant you, shall
      we find the matter withal.&rdquo; Master Nicholas spoke with the same
      enthusiasm as his chief, but with less of the dreamer in his voice and
      eye, and with more swift eagerness of the practical man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill it, indeed,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Why, Gad Zooks! man! who
      knoweth what happenings there are and what not till one essays the
      gathering of them! And should it chance that there is nothing of greater
      import, no boar hunt of his Majesty to record, nor the news of some great
      entertainment by one of the Lords of the Court, then will we put in lesser
      matter, aye whatever comes to hand, the talk of his Majesty&rsquo;s
      burgesses in the Parliament or any such things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; sneered the printer, &ldquo;the talk of his
      Majesty&rsquo;s burgesses in Westminster, forsooth! And what clerk or
      learned person would care to read of such? Or think you that His Majesty&rsquo;s
      Chamberlain would long bear that such idle chatter should be bruited
      abroad. If you can find no worthier thing for this our news sheet than the
      talk of the Burgesses, then shall it fail indeed. Had it been the speech
      of the King&rsquo;s great barons and the bishops twere different. But dost
      fancy that the great barons would allow that their weighty discourses be
      reduced to common speech so that even the vulgar may read it and haply
      here and there fathom their very thought itself,&mdash;and the bishops,
      the great prelates, to submit their ideas to the vulgar hand of a common
      printer, framing them into mere sentences! &lsquo;Tis unthinkable that
      they would sanction it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; murmured Caxton in his dreaming voice, &ldquo;the time
      shall come, Master Edward, when they will not only sanction it but seek
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; broke in Master Nick, &ldquo;let us have done with
      this talk? Whether there be enough happenings or not enough,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      here he spoke with a kindling eye and looked about him at the little group
      of apprentices and printers, who had drawn near to listen, &ldquo;if there
      be not enough, then will I MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. What is easier than to tell
      of happenings forth of the realm of which no man can know,&mdash;some talk
      of the Grand Turk and the war that he makes, or some happenings in the New
      Land found by Master Columbus. Aye,&rdquo; he went on, warming to his
      words and not knowing that he embodied in himself the first birth on earth
      of the telegraphic editor,&mdash;&ldquo;and why not. One day we write it
      out on our sheet &lsquo;The Grand Turk maketh disastrous war on the
      Bulgars of the North and hath burnt divers of their villages.&rsquo; And
      that hath no sooner gone forth than we print another sheet saying, It
      would seem that the villages be not burnt but only scorched, nor doth it
      appear that the Turk burnt them but that the Bulgars burnt divers villages
      of the Turk and are sitting now in his mosque in the city of Hadrian.&rsquo;
      Then shall all men run to and fro and read the sheet and question and ask,
      &lsquo;Is it thus?&rsquo; And, &lsquo;Is it thus?&rsquo; and by very
      uncertainty of circumstances, they shall demand the more curiously to see
      the news sheet and read it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, Master Nick,&rdquo; said Brenton, firmly, &ldquo;that
      will I never allow. Let us make it to ourselves a maxim that all that
      shall be said in this news sheet, or &lsquo;news paper,&rsquo; as my
      conceit would fain call it, for be it not made of paper (here a merry
      laugh of the apprentices greeted the quaint fancy of the Master), shall be
      of ascertained verity and fact indisputable. Should the Grand Turk make
      war and should the rumour of it come to these isles, then will we say
      &lsquo;The Turk maketh war,&rsquo; and should the Turk be at peace, then
      we will say &lsquo;The Turk it doth appear is now at peace.&rsquo; And
      should no news come, then shall we say &lsquo;In good sooth we know not
      whether the Turk destroyeth the Bulgars or whether he doth not, for while
      some hold that he harasseth them sorely, others have it that he harasseth
      them not, whereby we are sore put to it to know whether there be war or
      peace, nor do we desire to vex the patience of those who read by any
      further discourse on the matter, other than to say that we ourselves are
      in doubt what be and what be not truth, nor will we any further speak of
      it other than this.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Those about Caxton listened with awe to this speech. They did not,&mdash;they
      could not know,&mdash;that this was the birth of the Leading Article, but
      there was something in the strangely fascinating way in which their chief
      enlarged upon his own ignorance that foreshowed to the meanest
      intelligence the possibilities of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a poor plan, Master Brenton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      folk wish news, give them the news. The more thou givest them, the better
      pleased they are and thus doth the news sheet move from hand to hand till
      it may be said (if I too may coin a phrase) to increase vastly its &lsquo;circulation&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said Master Brenton, looking at Nicholas with a
      quiet expression that was not exempt from a certain slyness, &ldquo;there
      I do hold thou art in the wrong, even as a matter of craft or policie. For
      it seems to me that if our paper speaketh first this and then that but
      hath no fixed certainty of truth, sooner or later will all its talk seem
      vain, and no man will heed it. But if it speak always the truth, then
      sooner or later shall all come to believe it and say of any happening,
      &lsquo;It standeth written in the paper, therefore it is so.&rsquo; And
      here I charge you all that have any part in this new venture,&rdquo;
      continued Master Brenton, looking about the room at the listening faces
      and speaking with great seriousness, &ldquo;let us lay it to our hearts
      that our maxim shall be truth and truth alone. Let no man set his hand to
      aught that shall go upon our presses save only that which is assured
      truth. In this way shall our venture ever be pleasing to the Most High,
      and I do verily believe,&rdquo;&mdash;and here Caxton&rsquo;s voice sank
      lower as if he were thinking aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;in the long run, it will
      be mighty good for our circulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker paused. Then turning to the broad sheet before him, he began
      to scan its columns with his eye. The others stood watching him as he
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, Master Edward,&rdquo; he queried presently, &ldquo;here
      I see in this first induct, or column, as one names it, the word King
      fairly and truly spelled. Lower down it standeth Kyng, and yet further in
      the second induct Kynge, and in the last induct where there is talk of His
      Majesty&rsquo;s marvelous skill in the French game of palm or tennis, lo
      the word stands Quhyngge! How sayeth thou?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldst have it written always in but one and the same way?&rdquo;
      asked the printer in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, truly,&rdquo; said Caxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With never any choice, or variation to suit the fancy of him who
      reads so that he who likes it written King may see it so, and yet also he
      who would prefer it written in a freer style, or Quhyngge, may also find
      it so and thus both be pleased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I never have!&rdquo; said Master Brenton firmly, &ldquo;dost
      not remember, friend, the old tale in the fabula of Aesopus of him who
      would please all men. Here will I make another maxim for our newspaper.
      All men we cannot please, for in pleasing one belike we run counter to
      another. Let us set our hand to write always without fear. Let us seek
      favour with none. Always in our news sheet we will seek to speak dutifully
      and with all reverence of the King his Majesty: let us also speak with all
      respect and commendation of His Majesty&rsquo;s great prelates and nobles,
      for are they not the exalted of the land? Also I would have it that we say
      nothing harsh against our wealthy merchants and burgesses, for hath not
      the Lord prospered them in their substances. Yea, friends, let us speak
      ever well of the King, the clergy, the nobility and of all persons of
      wealth and substantial holdings. But beyond this&rdquo;&mdash;here Brenton
      Coxton&rsquo;s eye flashed,&mdash;&ldquo;let us speak with utter
      fearlessness of all men. So shall we be, if I may borrow a mighty good
      word from Tacitus his Annals, of a complete independence, hanging on to no
      man. In fact our venture shall be an independent newspaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The listeners felt an instinctive awe at the words, and again a strange
      prescience of the future made itself felt in every mind. Here for the
      first time in history was being laid down that fine, fearless creed that
      has made the independent press what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Caxton continued to glance his eye over the news sheet, murmuring
      his comments on what he saw,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! vastly fine, Master
      Nicholas,&mdash;this of the sailing of His Majesty&rsquo;s ships for
      Spain,&mdash;and this, too, of the Doge of Venice, his death, &lsquo;tis
      brave reading and maketh a fair discourse. Here also this likes me,
      &lsquo;tis shrewdly devised,&rdquo; and here he placed his finger on a
      particular spot on the news sheet,&mdash;&ldquo;here in speaking of the
      strange mishap of my Lord Arundel, thou useth a great S for strange, and
      setteth it in a line all by itself whereby the mind of him that reads is
      suddenly awakened, alarmed as it were by a bell in the night. &lsquo;Tis
      good. &lsquo;Tis well. But mark you, friend Nicholas, try it not too
      often, nor use your great letters too easily. In the case of my Lord
      Arundel, it is seemly, but for a mishap to a lesser person, let it stand
      in a more modest fashion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Then suddenly Caxton looked up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What manner of tale is this! What strange thing is here! In faith,
      Master Nicholas, whence hast thou so marvelous a thing! The whole world
      must know of it. Harken ye all to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let all men that be troubled of aches, spavins, rheums,
      boils, maladies of the spleen or humours of the blood, come forthwith to
      the sign of the Red Lantern in East Cheap. There shall they find one that
      hath a marvelous remedy for all such ailments, brought with great dangers
      and perils of the journey from a far distant land. This wonderous balm
      shall straightway make the sick to be well and the lame to walk. Rubbed on
      the eye it restoreth sight and applied to the ear it reviveth the hearing.
      Tis the sole invention of Doctor Gustavus Friedman, sometime of Gottingen
      and brought by him hitherwards out of the sheer pity of his heart for them
      that be afflicted, nor shall any other fee be asked for it save only such
      a light and tender charge as shall defray the cost of Doctor Friedman his
      coming and going.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Caxton paused and gazed at Master Nicholas in wonder. &ldquo;Whence hadst
      thou this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Nicholas smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had it of a chapman, or travelling doctor, who was most urgent
      that we set it forth straightway on the press.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it true?&rdquo; asked Caxton; &ldquo;thou hast it of a full
      surety of knowledge?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas laughed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True or false, I know not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the fellow
      was so curious that we should print it that he gave me two golden laurels
      and a new sovereign on the sole understanding that we should set it forth
      in print.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was deep silence for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He PAYETH to have it printed!&rdquo; said Caxton, deeply impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Master Nicholas, &ldquo;he payeth and will pay
      more. The fellow hath other balms equally potent. All of these he would
      admonish, or shall I say advert, the public.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Caxton, thoughtfully, &ldquo;he wishes to make, if
      I may borrow a phrase of Albertus Magnus, an advertisement of his goods.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;he payeth us. We advert the
      goods. Forthwith all men buy them. Then hath he more money. He payeth us
      again. We advert the goods more and still he payeth us. That would seem to
      me, friend Nick, a mighty good busyness for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; rejoined Nicholas, &ldquo;and after him others
      will come to advert other wares until belike a large part of our news
      sheet,&mdash;who knows? the whole of it, perhaps, shall be made up in the
      merry guise of advertisements.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Caxton sat silent in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Master Caxton&rdquo;&mdash;cried the voice of a young
      apprentice, a mere child, as he seemed, with fair hair and blue eyes
      filled with the native candour of unsullied youth,&mdash;&ldquo;is this
      tale true!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sayest thou, Warwick?&rdquo; said the master printer, almost
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good master, is the tale of the wonderous balm true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said Caxton, &ldquo;Master Nicholas, hath even said, we
      know not if it is true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didst thou not charge us,&rdquo; pleaded the boy, &ldquo;that
      all that went under our hand into the press should be truth and truth
      alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Caxton thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I spoke perhaps
      somewhat in overhaste. I see that we must here distinguish. Whether this
      is true or not we cannot tell. But it is PAID FOR, and that lifts it, as
      who should say, out of the domain of truth. The very fact that it is paid
      for giveth it, as it were, a new form of merit, a verity altogether its
      own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Nicholas, with a twinkle in his shrewd eyes,
      &ldquo;entirely its own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed so,&rdquo; said Caxton, &ldquo;and here let us make to
      ourselves another and a final maxim of guidance. All things that any man
      will pay for, these we will print, whether true or not, for that doth not
      concern us. But if one cometh here with any strange tale of a remedy or
      aught else and wishes us to make advertisement of it and hath no money to
      pay for it, then shall he be cast forth out of this officina, or office,
      if I may call it so, neck and crop into the street. Nay, I will have me
      one of great strength ever at the door ready for such castings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of approval went round the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caxton would have spoken further but at the moment the sound of a bell was
      heard booming in the street without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the Great Bell,&rdquo; said Caxton, &ldquo;ringing out
      the hour of noon. Quick, all of you to your task. Lay me the forms on the
      press and speed me the work. We start here a great adventure. Mark well
      the maxims I have given you, and God speed our task.&rdquo;
    </p>

      And in another hour or so, the prentice boys of the master printer were
      calling in the streets the sale of the first English newspaper.

      XVII&mdash;IN THE GOOD TIME AFTER THE WAR
    </h2>

      [Footnote: An extract from a London newspaper of 1916.]

    <h3>
      HOUSE OF COMMONS REPORT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister in rising said that he thought the time had now come
      when the House might properly turn its attention again to domestic
      affairs. The foreign world was so tranquil that there was really nothing
      of importance which need be brought to the attention of the House.
      Members, however, would, perhaps, be glad to learn incidentally that a new
      and more comfortable cage had been supplied for the ex-German Emperor, and
      that the ex-Crown Prince was now showing distinct signs of intelligence,
      and was even able to eat quite quietly out of his keeper&rsquo;s hand.
      Members would be gratified to know that at last the Hohenzollern family
      were able to abstain from snapping at the hand that fed them. But he would
      now turn to the subject of Home Rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the House was seen to yawn noticeably, and a general lack of interest
      was visible, especially among the Nationalist and Ulster members. A number
      of members were seen to rise as if about to move to the refreshment- room.
      Mr. John Redmond and Sir Edward Carson were seen walking arm in arm
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister. &ldquo;Will the members kindly keep their seats? We
      are about to hold a discussion on Home Rule. Members will surely recall
      that this form of discussion was one of our favourite exercises only a
      year or so ago. I trust that members have not lost interest in the
      subject.&rdquo; (General laughter among the members, and cries of &ldquo;Cut
      it out!&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister (with some asperity). &ldquo;Members are well aware
      what Home Rule meant. It was a plan&mdash;or rather it was a scheme&mdash;that
      is to say, it was an act of parliament, or I should say a bill, in fact,
      Mr. Speaker, I don&rsquo;t mind confessing that, not having my papers with
      me, I am unable to inform the House just what Home Rule was. I think,
      perhaps, the Ex-Minister of Munitions has a copy of last year&rsquo;s
      bill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lloyd George rising, with evident signs of boredom. &ldquo;The House
      will excuse me. I am tired. I have been out all day aeroplaning with Mr.
      Churchill and Mr. Bonar Law, with a view to inspect the new national
      training camp. I had the Home Rule Bill with me along with the Welsh
      Disestablishment Bill and the Land Bill, and I am afraid that I lost the
      whole bally lot of them; dropped them into the sea or something. I hope
      the Speaker will overlook the term &lsquo;bally.&rsquo; It may not be
      parliamentary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speaker (laughing). &ldquo;Tut, tut, never mind a little thing like
      that. I am sure that after all that we have gone through together, the
      House is quite agreed that a little thing like parliamentary procedure
      doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lloyd George (humbly). &ldquo;Still I am sorry for the term. I&rsquo;d
      like to withdraw it. I separate or distinguish in any degree the men of
      Ulster from the men of Tipperary, and the heart of Belfast from the heart
      of Dublin.&rdquo; (Loud cheers.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redmond (springing forward). &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll say this: Not I,
      nor any man of Ireland, Dublin, Belfast, or Connaught will ever set our
      hands or names to any bill that shall separate Ireland in any degree from
      the rest of the Empire. Work out, if you like, a new scheme of government.
      If the financial clauses are intricate, get one of your treasury clerks to
      solve them. If there&rsquo;s trouble in arranging your excise on your
      customs, settle it in any way you please. But it is too late now to
      separate England and Ireland. We&rsquo;ve held the flag of the Empire in
      our hand. We mean to hold it in our grasp forever. We have seen its
      colours tinged a brighter red with the best of Ireland&rsquo;s blood, and
      that proud stain shall stay forever as the symbol of the unity of Irish
      and the English people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Loud cheers ring through the House; several members rise in great
      excitement, all shouting and speaking together.) There is heard the voice
      of Mr. Angus McCluskey, Member for the Hebrides, calling&mdash;&ldquo;And
      ye&rsquo;ll no forget Scotland, me lad, when you talk of unity! Do you
      mind the Forty-Second, and the London Scottish in the trenches of the
      Aisne? Wha carried the flag of the Empire then? Unity, ma friends, ye&rsquo;ll
      never break it. It may involve a wee bit sacrifice for Scotland
      financially speaking. I&rsquo;ll no say no to a reveesion of the monetairy
      terms, if ye suggest it,&mdash;but for unita&mdash;Scotland and the
      Empire, now and forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A great number of members have risen in their seats. Mr. Open Ap Owen
      Glendower is calling: &ldquo;Aye and Wales! never forget Wales.&rdquo; Mr.
      Trevelyan Trendinning of Cornwall has started singing &ldquo;And shall
      Trelawney Die?&rdquo;&mdash;while the deep booming of &ldquo;Rule
      Britannia&rdquo; from five hundred throats ascends to the very rafters of
      the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker laughing and calling for order, while two of the more elderly
      clerks are beating with the mace on the table,&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen,
      gentlemen, I have a proposal to make. I have just learned that there is at
      the Alhambra in Leicester Square, a real fine moving picture show of the
      entrance of the Allies into Berlin. Let&rsquo;s all go to it. We can leave
      a committee of the three youngest members to stay behind and draw up a new
      government for Ireland. Even they can&rsquo;t go wrong now as to what we
      want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud Cheers as the House empties, singing &ldquo;It was a Long Way to
      Tipperary, but the way lay through Berlin.&rdquo;
